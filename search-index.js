section contains advanced information describing the different ways you can run and manage RKE2. By default, certificates in RKE2 expire in 12 months. If the certificates are expired or have fewer than 90 days remaining before they expire, the certificates are rotated when RKE2 is restarted. As of v1.21.8+rke2r1, certificates can also be rotated manually. To do this, it is best to stop the rke2-server process, rotate the certificates, then start the process up again: systemctl stop rke2-server rke2 certificate rotate systemctl start rke2-server To renew agent certificates, restart rke2-agent in agent nodes. Agent certificates are renewed every time the agent starts. systemctl restart rke2-agent It is also possible to rotate an individual service by passing the --service flag, for example: rke2 certificate rotate --service api-server. See Certificate Management for more details. Any file found in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests will automatically be deployed to Kubernetes in a manner similar to kubectl apply. For information about deploying Helm charts using the manifests directory, refer to the section about Helm. RKE2 will generate the config.toml for containerd in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml. For advanced customization of this file you can create another file called config.toml.tmpl in the same directory and it will be used instead. The config.toml.tmpl will be treated as a Go template file, and the config.Node structure is being passed to the template. See this template for an example of how to use the structure to customize the configuration file. If you are running RKE2 in an environment, which only has external connectivity through an HTTP proxy, you can configure your proxy settings on the RKE2 systemd service. These proxy settings will then be used in RKE2 and passed down to the embedded containerd and kubelet. Add the necessary HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY and NO_PROXY variables to the environment file of your systemd service, usually: /etc/default/rke2-server /etc/default/rke2-agent RKE2 will automatically add the cluster internal Pod and Service IP ranges and cluster DNS domain to the list of NO_PROXY entries. You should ensure that the IP address ranges used by the Kubernetes nodes themselves (i.e. the public and private IPs of the nodes) are included in the NO_PROXY list, or that the nodes can be reached through the proxy. HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 HTTPS_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16 If you want to configure the proxy settings for containerd without affecting RKE2 and the Kubelet, you can prefix the variables with CONTAINERD_: CONTAINERD_HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 CONTAINERD_HTTPS_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 CONTAINERD_NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16 RKE2 agents can be configured with the options node-label and node-taint which adds a label and taint to the kubelet. The two options only add labels and/or taints at registration time, and can only be added once and not removed after that through rke2 commands. If you want to change node labels and taints after node registration you should use kubectl. Refer to the official Kubernetes documentation for details on how to add taints and node labels. Agent nodes are registered via a websocket connection initiated by the rke2 agent process, and the connection is maintained by a client-side load balancer running as part of the agent process. Agents register with the server using the cluster secret portion of the join token, along with a randomly generated node-specific password, which is stored on the agent at /etc/rancher/node/password. The server will store the passwords for individual nodes as Kubernetes secrets, and any subsequent attempts must use the same password. Node password secrets are stored in the kube-system namespace with names using the template .node-password.rke2. These secrets are deleted when the corresponding Kubernetes node is deleted. Prior to RKE2 v1.20.2 servers stored passwords on disk at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/node-passwd. If the /etc/rancher/node directory of an agent is removed, the password file should be recreated for the agent prior to startup, or the entry removed from the server or Kubernetes cluster (depending on the RKE2 version). The installation script provides units for systemd, but does not enable or start the service by default. When running with systemd, logs will be created in /var/log/syslog and viewed using journalctl -u rke2-server or journalctl -u rke2-agent. An example of installing with the install script: curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sh - systemctl enable rke2-server systemctl start rke2-server The server charts bundled with rke2 deployed during cluster bootstrapping can be disabled and replaced with alternatives. A common use case is replacing the bundled rke2-ingress-nginx chart with an alternative. To disable any of the bundled system charts, set the disable parameter in the config file before bootstrapping. An example of disabling all available system charts is: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml disable: - rke2-coredns - rke2-ingress-nginx - rke2-metrics-server - rke2-snapshot-controller - rke2-snapshot-controller-crd - rke2-snapshot-validation-webhook It is the cluster operator’s responsibility to ensure that components are disabled or replaced with care, as the server charts play important roles in cluster operability. Refer to the architecture overview for more information on the individual system charts role within the cluster. In public AWS regions, to ensure RKE2 is cloud-enabled, and capable of auto-provisioning certain cloud resources, config RKE2 with: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml cloud-provider-name: aws When installing RKE2 on classified regions (such as SC2S or C2S), there are a few additional pre-requisites to be aware of to ensure RKE2 knows how and where to securely communicate with the appropriate AWS endpoints: Ensure all the common AWS cloud-provider prerequisites are met. These are independent of regions and are always required. Ensure RKE2 knows where to send API requests for ec2 and elasticloadbalancing services by creating a cloud.conf file, the below is an example for the us-iso-east-1 (C2S) region: # /etc/rancher/rke2/cloud.conf [Global] [ServiceOverride \"ec2\"] Service=ec2 Region=us-iso-east-1 URL=https://ec2.us-iso-east-1.c2s.ic.gov SigningRegion=us-iso-east-1 [ServiceOverride \"elasticloadbalancing\"] Service=elasticloadbalancing Region=us-iso-east-1 URL=https://elasticloadbalancing.us-iso-east-1.c2s.ic.gov SigningRegion=us-iso-east-1 Alternatively, if you are using private AWS endpoints, ensure the appropriate URL is used for each of the private endpoints. Ensure the appropriate AWS CA bundle is loaded into the system’s root ca trust store. This may already be done for you depending on the AMI you are using. # on CentOS/RHEL 7/8 cp /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ update-ca-trust Configure RKE2 to use the aws cloud-provider with the custom cloud.conf created in step 1: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml ... cloud-provider-name: aws cloud-provider-config: \"/etc/rancher/rke2/cloud.conf\" ... Install RKE2 normally (most likely in an airgapped capacity) Validate successful installation by confirming the existence of AWS metadata on cluster node labels with kubectl get nodes --show-labels The following options are available under the server sub-command for RKE2. The options allow for specifying CPU requests and limits for the control plane components within RKE2. --control-plane-resource-requests value (components) Control Plane resource requests [$RKE2_CONTROL_PLANE_RESOURCE_REQUESTS] --control-plane-resource-limits value (components) Control Plane resource limits [$RKE2_CONTROL_PLANE_RESOURCE_LIMITS] Values are a comma-delimited list of [controlplane-component]-(cpu|memory)=[desired-value]. The possible values for controlplane-component are: kube-apiserver kube-scheduler kube-controller-manager kube-proxy etcd cloud-controller-manager Thus, an example config may value may look like: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml control-plane-resource-requests: - kube-apiserver-cpu=500m - kube-apiserver-memory=512M - kube-scheduler-cpu=250m - kube-scheduler-memory=512M - etcd-cpu=1000m The unit values for CPU/memory are identical to Kubernetes resource units (See: Resource Limits in Kubernetes). The following options are available under the server sub-command for RKE2. These options specify host-path mounting of directories from the node filesystem into the static pod component that corresponds to the prefixed name. Flag ENV VAR --kube-apiserver-extra-mount RKE2_KUBE_APISERVER_EXTRA_MOUNT kube-apiserver extra volume mounts --kube-scheduler-extra-mount RKE2_KUBE_SCHEDULER_EXTRA_MOUNT kube-scheduler extra volume mounts --kube-controller-manager-extra-mount RKE2_KUBE_CONTROLLER_MANAGER_EXTRA_MOUNT --kube-proxy-extra-mount RKE2_KUBE_PROXY_EXTRA_MOUNT --etcd-extra-mount RKE2_ETCD_EXTRA_MOUNT --cloud-controller-manager-extra-mount RKE2_CLOUD_CONTROLLER_MANAGER_EXTRA_MOUNT /source/volume/path/on/host:/destination/volume/path/in/staticpod In order to mount a volume as read only, append :ro to the end of the volume mount: /source/volume/path/on/host:/destination/volume/path/in/staticpod:ro Multiple volume mounts can be specified for the same component by passing the flag values as an array in the config file. Version Gate Prior to April 2024 releases (v1.27.13+rke2r1, v1.28.9+rke2r1, v1.29.4+rke2r1), only directories can be mounted. # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml kube-apiserver-extra-mount: - \"/tmp/foo:/root/foo\" - \"/tmp/bar.txt:/etc/bar.txt:ro\" The following options are available under the server sub-command for RKE2.

It includes everything needed for pods to be able to operate GPUs. Depending on the underlying OS, some steps need to be fulfilled SLES Ubuntu RHEL The NVIDIA operator cannot automatically install kernel drivers on SLES. NVIDIA drivers must be manually installed on all GPU nodes before deploying the operator in the cluster. It can be done with the following steps: # Assuming you are using sle15sp5, if different, change the url accordingly sudo zypper addrepo --refresh 'https://download.nvidia.com/suse/sle15sp5' NVIDIA sudo zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh sudo zypper install -y ---auto-agree-with-licenses nvidia-gl-G06 nvidia-video-G06 nvidia-compute-utils-G06 Then reboot. If everything worked correctly, after the reboot, you should see the NVRM and GCC version of the driver when executing the command: cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version Finally, create the symlink: sudo ln -s /sbin/ldconfig /sbin/ldconfig.real ``` The NVIDIA operator can automatically install kernel drivers on Ubuntu using the nvidia-driver-daemonset, although not all versions are supported. You can also pre-install them manually and the operator will detect them: sudo apt install nvidia-driver-535-server Then reboot. If everything worked correctly, after the reboot, you should see a correct output when executing the command: cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version The NVIDIA operator can automatically install kernel drivers on RHEL using the nvidia-driver-daemonset. You would only need to create the symlink: sudo ln -s /sbin/ldconfig /sbin/ldconfig.real Once the OS is ready and RKE2 is running, install the GPU Operator with the following yaml manifest: apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChart metadata: name: gpu-operator namespace: kube-system spec: repo: https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia chart: gpu-operator targetNamespace: gpu-operator createNamespace: true valuesContent: |- toolkit: env: - name: CONTAINERD_SOCKET value: /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock The NVIDIA operator restarts containerd with a hangup call which restarts RKE2. After one minute approximately, you can make the following checks to verify that everything worked as expected: Check if the operator detected the driver and GPU correctly: kubectl get node $NODENAME -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}' | jq | grep \"nvidia.com\" You should see labels specifying driver and GPU (e.g. nvidia.com/gpu.machine or nvidia.com/cuda.driver.major). Check if the gpu was added (by nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset) as an allocatable resource in the node: kubectl get node $NODENAME -o jsonpath='{.status.allocatable}' | jq You should see \"nvidia.com/gpu\": followed by the number of gpus in the node. Check that the container runtime binary was installed by the operator (in particular by the nvidia-container-toolkit-daemonset): ls /usr/local/nvidia/toolkit/nvidia-container-runtime Verify if containerd config was updated to include the nvidia container runtime: grep nvidia /etc/containerd/config.toml Run a pod to verify that the GPU resource can successfully be scheduled on a pod and the pod can detect it. apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: name: nbody-gpu-benchmark namespace: default spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure runtimeClassName: nvidia containers: - name: cuda-container image: nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/cuda-sample:nbody args: [\"nbody\", \"-gpu\", \"-benchmark\"] resources: limits: nvidia.com/gpu: 1 env: - name: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES value: all - name: NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES value: all","title":"Advanced Options and Configuration","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"advanced","url":"/rke2/latest/en/advanced.html","titles":[{"text":"Certificate Rotation","hash":"_certificate_rotation","id":1},{"text":"Auto-Deploying Manifests","hash":"_auto_deploying_manifests","id":2},{"text":"Configuring containerd","hash":"_configuring_containerd","id":3},{"text":"Configuring an HTTP proxy","hash":"_configuring_an_http_proxy","id":4},{"text":"Node Labels and Taints","hash":"_node_labels_and_taints","id":5},{"text":"How Agent Node Registration Works","hash":"_how_agent_node_registration_works","id":6},{"text":"Starting the Server with the Installation Script","hash":"_starting_the_server_with_the_installation_script","id":7},{"text":"Disabling Server Charts","hash":"_disabling_server_charts","id":8},{"text":"Installation on classified AWS regions or networks with custom AWS API endpoints","hash":"_installation_on_classified_aws_regions_or_networks_with_custom_aws_api_endpoints","id":9},{"text":"Control Plane Component Resource Requests/Limits","hash":"_control_plane_component_resource_requestslimits","id":10},{"text":"Extra Control Plane Component Volume Mounts","hash":"_extra_control_plane_component_volume_mounts","id":11},{"text":"RW Host Path Volume Mount","hash":"_rw_host_path_volume_mount","id":12},{"text":"RO Host Path Volume Mount","hash":"_ro_host_path_volume_mount","id":13},{"text":"Extra Control Plane Component Environment Variables","hash":"_extra_control_plane_component_environment_variables","id":14},{"text":"Deploy NVIDIA operator","hash":"_deploy_nvidia_operator","id":15}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"With RKE2 we take lessons learned from developing and maintaining our lightweight Kubernetes distribution, K3s, and apply them to build an enterprise-ready distribution with K3s ease-of-use. What this means is that RKE2 is, at its simplest, a single binary to be installed and configured on all nodes expected to participate in the Kubernetes cluster. Once started, RKE2 is then able to bootstrap and supervise role-appropriate agents per node while sourcing needed content from the network. RKE2 brings together a number of Open Source technologies to make this all work: K3s Helm Controller K8s API Server Controller Manager Kubelet Scheduler Proxy etcd runc containerd, cri CNI: Canal (Calico & Flannel), Cilium or Calico CoreDNS Ingress NGINX Controller Metrics Server Helm All of these, except the NGINX Ingress Controller, are compiled and statically linked with Go+BoringCrypto. RKE2 sources binaries and manifests to run both server and agent nodes from the RKE2 Runtime image. This means RKE2 scans /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/*.tar for the rancher/rke2-runtime image (with a tag correlating to the output of rke2 --version) by default and if it cannot be found, attempts to pull it from the network (a.k.a. Docker Hub). RKE2 then extracts /bin/ from the image, flattening it into /var/lib/rancher/rke2/data/${RKE2_DATA_KEY}/bin where ${RKE2_DATA_KEY} represents a unique string identifying the image. For RKE2 to work as expected the runtime image must minimally provide: containerd (the CRI) containerd-shim (shims wrap runc tasks and do not stop when containerd does) containerd-shim-runc-v1 containerd-shim-runc-v2 kubelet (the Kubernetes node agent) runc (the OCI runtime) The following ops tooling is also provided by the runtime image: ctr (low level containerd maintenance and inspection) crictl (low level CRI maintenance and inspection) kubectl (kubernetes cluster maintenance and inspection) socat (needed by containerd for port-forwarding) After the binaries have been extracted RKE2 will then extract charts from the image into the /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests directory. In the embedded K3s engine servers are specialized agent processes which means that the following startup will be deferred until the node container runtime has started. Pull the kube-apiserver image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for etcd and then write the static pod definition in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/. Pull the kube-controller-manager image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for kube-apiserver and then write the static pod definition in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/. Pull the kube-scheduler image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for kube-apiserver and then write the static pod definition in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/. Spin up an HTTP server in a goroutine to listen for other cluster servers/agents then initialize/join the cluster. Pull the etcd image, if not present already, and spin up a goroutine to wait for the kubelet and then write the static pod definition in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/pod-manifests/. Spin up the goroutine to start the embedded helm-controller after waiting for kube-apiserver to be ready. The agent process entry point. For server processes the embedded K3s engine invokes this directly. Spawn the containerd process and listen for termination. If containerd exits then the rke2 process will also exit. Spawn and supervise the kubelet process. If kubelet exits then rke2 will attempt to restart it. Once the kubelet is running it will start any available static pods. For servers this means that etcd and kube-apiserver will start, in succession, allowing the remaining components started via static pod to connect to the kube-apiserver and begin their processing.

Snapshots are enabled by default. The snapshot directory defaults to /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/snapshots. To configure the snapshot interval or the number of retained snapshots, refer to the options. In RKE2, snapshots are stored on each etcd node. If you have multiple etcd or etcd + control-plane nodes, you will have multiple copies of local etcd snapshots. You can take a snapshot manually while RKE2 is running with the etcd-snapshot subcommand. For example: rke2 etcd-snapshot save --name pre-upgrade-snapshot. RKE2 enables a feature to reset the cluster to one member cluster by passing --cluster-reset flag, when passing this flag to RKE2 server it will reset the cluster with the same data dir in place, the data directory for etcd exists in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd, this flag can be passed in the events of quorum loss in the cluster. To pass the reset flag, first you need to stop RKE2 service if its enabled via systemd: systemctl stop rke2-server rke2 server --cluster-reset Result: A message in the logs say that RKE2 can be restarted without the flags. Start RKE2 again and it should start RKE2 as a 1 member cluster. When RKE2 is restored from backup, the old data directory will be moved to /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd-old-%date%/. RKE2 will then attempt to restore the snapshot by creating a new data directory and start etcd with a new RKE2 cluster with one etcd member. You must stop RKE2 service on all server nodes if it is enabled via systemd. Use the following command to do so: systemctl stop rke2-server Next, you will initiate the restore from snapshot on the first server node with the following commands: rke2 server \\ --cluster-reset \\ --cluster-reset-restore-path= Once the restore process is complete, start the rke2-server service on the first server node as follows: systemctl start rke2-server Remove the RKE2 db directory on the other server nodes as follows: rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db Start the rke2-server service on other server nodes with the following command: systemctl start rke2-server Result: After a successful restore, a message in the logs says that etcd is running, and RKE2 can be restarted without the flags. Start RKE2 again, and it should run successfully and be restored from the specified snapshot. When RKE2 resets the cluster, it creates an empty file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/reset-flag. This file is harmless to leave in place, but must be removed in order to perform subsequent resets or restores. This file is deleted when RKE2 starts normally. For all versions of RKE2 v.1.20.9 and prior, you will need to back up and restore certificates first due to a known issue in which bootstrap data might not save on restore (Steps 1 - 3 below assume this scenario). See note below for an additional version-specific restore caveat on restore. Back up the following: /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred, /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls, /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token, /etc/rancher Restore the certs in Step 1 above to the first new server node. Install RKE2 v1.20.8+rke2r1 on the first new server node as in the following example: curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=\"v1.20.8+rke2r1\" sh - Stop RKE2 service on all server nodes if it is enabled and initiate the restore from snapshot on the first server node with the following commands: systemctl stop rke2-server rke2 server \\ --cluster-reset \\ --cluster-reset-restore-path= Once the restore process is complete, start the rke2-server service on the first server node as follows: systemctl start rke2-server You can continue to add new server and worker nodes to cluster per standard RKE2 HA installation documentation. When performing a restore from backup, users do not need to restore a snapshot using the same version of RKE2 with which the snapshot was created. Users may restore using a more recent version. Be aware when changing versions at restore which etcd version is in use. By default, snapshots are enabled and are scheduled to be taken every 12 hours. The snapshots are written to ${data-dir}/server/db/snapshots with the default ${data-dir} being /var/lib/rancher/rke2. When restoring RKE2 from backup to a new node in RKE2 v1.20.11+rke2r1, you should ensure that all pods are stopped following the initial restore by running rke2-killall.sh as follows: curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=v1.20.11+rke2r1 rke2 server \\ --cluster-reset \\ --cluster-reset-restore-path= \\ --token= rke2-killall.sh Once the restore process is complete, enable and start the rke2-server service on the first server node as follows: systemctl enable rke2-server systemctl start rke2-server RKE2 supports writing etcd snapshots to and restoring etcd snapshots from systems with S3-compatible APIs. S3 support is available for both on-demand and scheduled snapshots. The arguments below exist for both the server and etcd-snapshot subcommands.

Defaults to 30s Flag Aliases For the etcd-snapshot subcommand, the --etcd-s3 flags are aliased to --s3. To perform an on-demand etcd snapshot and save it to S3: rke2 etcd-snapshot \\ --s3 \\ --s3-bucket= \\ --s3-access-key= \\ --s3-secret-key= To perform an S3 etcd snapshot restore, first make sure that RKE2 isn’t running.

Deleting files out of this directory will not delete the corresponding resources from the cluster. Manifests deployed in this manner are managed as AddOn custom resources, and can be viewed by running kubectl get addon -A. By default, you will find AddOns for packaged components such as CoreDNS, Nginx-Ingress, and Metrics Server. AddOns are created automatically by the deploy controller, and are named based on their filename in the manifests directory. It is also possible to deploy Helm charts as AddOns. RKE2 includes a Helm Controller that manages Helm charts using a HelmChart Custom Resource Definition (CRD). The AddOn name for each file in the manifest directory is derived from the file basename. Ensure that all files within the manifests directory (or within any subdirectories) have names that are unique, and adhere to Kubernetes object naming restrictions. Care should also be taken not to conflict with names in use by the default RKE2 packaged components, even if those components are disabled. An example of an error that would be reported if the file name contains underscores: `Failed to process config: failed to process /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/example_manifest.yaml: Addon.k3s.cattle.io \"example_manifest\" is invalid: metadata.name: Invalid value: \"example_manifest\": a lowercase RFC 1123 subdomain must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'example.com', regex used for validation is '[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\\\\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*')` The AddOns for packaged components listed above, in addition to AddOns for any additional manifests placed in the manifests directory, can be disabled with the --disable flag. Disabled AddOns are actively uninstalled from the cluster, and the source files deleted from the manifests directory. For example, to disable CoreDNS from being installed on a new cluster, or to uninstall it and remove the manifest from an existing cluster, you can start RKE2 with disable: rke2-coredns in the config file. Multiple items can be disabled in a nested list. # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml disable: - rke2-coredns - rke2-metrics-server The HelmChart resource definition captures most of the options you would normally pass to the helm command-line tool. Here’s an example of how you might deploy Grafana from the default chart repository, overriding some of the default chart values. Note that the HelmChart resource itself is in the kube-system namespace, but the chart’s resources will be deployed to the monitoring namespace. apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChart metadata: name: grafana namespace: kube-system spec: chart: stable/grafana targetNamespace: monitoring set: adminPassword: \"NotVerySafePassword\" valuesContent: |- image: tag: master env: GF_EXPLORE_ENABLED: true adminUser: admin sidecar: datasources: enabled: true An example of deploying a helm chart from a private repo with authentication: apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChart metadata: namespace: kube-system name: example-app spec: targetNamespace: example-space createNamespace: true version: v1.2.3 chart: example-app repo: https://secure-repo.example.com authSecret: name: example-repo-auth repoCAConfigMap: name: example-repo-ca valuesContent: |- image: tag: v1.2.2 --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: namespace: kube-system name: example-repo-auth type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth stringData: username: user password: pass --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: namespace: kube-system name: example-repo-ca data: ca.crt: |- -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- -----END CERTIFICATE----- Field Default Description Helm Argument / Flag Equivalent metadata.name Helm Chart name NAME spec.chart Helm Chart name in repository, or complete HTTPS URL to chart archive (.tgz) CHART spec.targetNamespace default Helm Chart target namespace --namespace spec.createNamespace false Create target namespace if not present --create-namespace spec.version Helm Chart version (when installing from repository) --version spec.repo Helm Chart repository URL --repo spec.repoCA Verify certificates of HTTPS-enabled servers using this CA bundle.

The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart, and supports providing additional valuesContent, which is passed to the helm command as an additional value file. HelmChart spec.set values override HelmChart and HelmChartConfig spec.valuesContent settings. For example, to customize the packaged CoreDNS configuration, you can create a file named /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-coredns-config.yaml and populate it with the following content: apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-coredns namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- image: coredns/coredns imageTag: v1.7.1 You can find all the packaged Helm charts including their documentation and default values in the RKE2 charts repository.","title":"Helm Integration","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"helm","url":"/rke2/latest/en/helm.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatically Deploying Manifests and Helm Charts","hash":"_automatically_deploying_manifests_and_helm_charts","id":1},{"text":"File Naming Requirements","hash":"_file_naming_requirements","id":2},{"text":"Disabling AddOns","hash":"_disabling_addons","id":3},{"text":"Using the Helm CRD","hash":"_using_the_helm_crd","id":4},{"text":"HelmChart Field Definitions","hash":"_helmchart_field_definitions","id":5},{"text":"Customizing Packaged Components with HelmChartConfig","hash":"_customizing_packaged_components_with_helmchartconfig","id":6}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"SUSE® Rancher Prime: RKE2, also known as RKE Government, is Rancher’s next-generation Kubernetes distribution.

If you come across issues with rke2 not documented here, please open a new issue here. Firewalld conflicts with RKE2’s default Canal (Calico + Flannel) networking stack. To avoid unexpected behavior, firewalld should be disabled on systems running RKE2. NetworkManager manipulates the routing table for interfaces in the default network namespace where many CNIs, including RKE2’s default, create veth pairs for connections to containers. This can interfere with the CNI’s ability to route correctly. As such, if installing RKE2 on a NetworkManager enabled system, it is highly recommended to configure NetworkManager to ignore calico/flannel related network interfaces. In order to do this, create a configuration file called rke2-canal.conf in /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d with the contents: [keyfile] unmanaged-devices=interface-name:cali*;interface-name:flannel* If you have not yet installed RKE2, a simple systemctl reload NetworkManager will suffice to install the configuration. If performing this configuration change on a system that already has RKE2 installed, a reboot of the node is necessary to effectively apply the changes. In some operating systems like RHEL 8.4, NetworkManager includes two extra services called nm-cloud-setup.service and nm-cloud-setup.timer. These services add a routing table that interfere with the CNI plugin’s configuration. Unfortunately, there is no config that can avoid that as explained in the issue. Therefore, if those services exist, they should be disabled. Before NetworkManager-1.30.0-11.el8_4, the node must also be rebooted after disabling the extra services. This is due to just-in-time kernel module loading of rke2, which is disallowed under Selinux unless the container is privileged. To allow Istio to run under these conditions, it requires two steps: Enable CNI as part of the Istio install. Please note that this feature is still in Alpha state at the time of this writing. Ensure values.cni.cniBinDir=/opt/cni/bin and values.cni.cniConfDir=/etc/cni/net.d After the install is complete, there should be cni-node pods in a CrashLoopBackoff. Manually edit their daemonset to include securityContext.privileged: true on the install-cni container. This can be performed via a custom overlay as follows: apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1 kind: IstioOperator spec: components: cni: enabled: true k8s: overlays: - apiVersion: \"apps/v1\" kind: \"DaemonSet\" name: \"istio-cni-node\" patches: - path: spec.template.spec.containers.[name:install-cni].securityContext.privileged value: true values: cni: image: rancher/mirrored-istio-install-cni:1.9.3 excludeNamespaces: - istio-system - kube-system logLevel: info cniBinDir: /opt/cni/bin cniConfDir: /etc/cni/net.d For more information regarding exact failures with detailed logs when not following these steps, please see Issue 504. RKE2 v1.19.5+ ships with containerd v1.4.x or later, hence should run on cgroups v2 capable systems. Older versions (< 1.19.5) are shipped with containerd 1.3.x fork (with back-ported SELinux commits from 1.4.x) which does not support cgroups v2 and requires a little up-front configuration: Assuming a systemd-based system, setting the https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html#systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy kernel parameter will indicate to systemd that it should run with hybrid (cgroups v1 + v2) support. Combined with the above, setting the systemd.legacy_systemd_cgroup_controller kernel parameter will indicate to systemd that it should run with legacy (cgroups v1) support. As these are kernel command-line arguments they must be set in the system bootloader so that they will be passed to systemd as PID 1 at /sbin/init. See: grub2 manual systemd manual cgroups v2 Calico hits a kernel bug when using vxlan encapsulation and the checksum offloading of the vxlan interface is on. The issue is described in the calico project and in rke2 project. The workaround we are applying is disabling the checksum offloading by default by applying the value ChecksumOffloadBroken=true in the calico helm chart. This issue has been observed in Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04 and openSUSE Leap 15.3 Wicked configures the networking settings of the host based on the sysctl configuration files (e.g. under /etc/sysctl.d/ directory). Even though rke2 is setting parameters such as /net/ipv4/conf/all/forwarding to 1, that configuration could be reverted by Wicked whenever it reapplies the network configuration (there are several events that result in reapplying the network configuration as well as rcwicked restart during updates). Consequently, it is very important to enable ipv4 (and ipv6 in case of dual-stack) forwarding in sysctl configuration files. For example, it is recommended to create a file with the name /etc/sysctl.d/90-rke2.conf containing these parameters (ipv6 only needed in case of dual-stack): net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 There are two possible reasons for this: iptables binary is not installed in the host and there is a pod defining a hostPort. The pod will be given an IP but its creation will fail and Kubernetes will not cease trying to recreate it, consuming one IP every time it tries. Error messages similar to the following will appear in the containerd log. This is the log showing the error: plugin type=\"portmap\" failed (add): failed to open iptables: exec: \"iptables\": executable file not found in $PATH Please install iptables or xtables-nft package to resolve this problem By default Canal keeps track of pod IPs by creating a lock file for each IP in /var/lib/cni/networks/k8s-pod-network. Each IP belongs to a single pod and will be deleted as soon as the pod is removed. However, in the unlikely event that containerd loses track of the running pods, lock files may be leaked and Canal will not be able to reuse those IPs anymore. If this occurs, you may experience IP exhaustion errors, for example: failed to allocate for range 0: no IP addresses available in range set There are two ways to resolve this. You can either manually remove unused IPs from that directory or drain the node, run rke2-killall.sh, start the rke2 systemd service and uncordon the node. If you need to undertake any of these actions, please report the problem via GitHub, making sure to specify how it was triggered. By default, when RKE2 is run with a CIS profile selected by the profile parameter, it applies network policies that can be restrictive for ingress. This, coupled with the rke2-ingress-nginx chart having hostNetwork: false by default, requires users to set network policies of their own to allow access to the ingress URLs. Below is an example networkpolicy that allows ingress to any workload in the namespace it is applied in. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/ for more configuration options. apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name: ingress-to-backends spec: podSelector: {} ingress: - from: - namespaceSelector: matchLabels: kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system podSelector: matchLabels: app.kubernetes.io/name: rke2-ingress-nginx policyTypes: - Ingress For more information, refer to comments on https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/3195. Kubernetes removed PodSecurityPolicy from v1.25 in favor of Pod Security Standards. You can read more about PSS in the upstream documentation. For RKE2, there are some manual steps that must be taken if the profile flag has been set on the nodes. On all nodes, update the profile value to cis-1.23, but do not restart or upgrade RKE2 yet. Perform the upgrade as normal. If using Automated Upgrades, ensure that the namespace where the system-upgrade-controller pod is running in is setup to be privileged in accordance with the Pod Security levels: apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata: name: system-upgrade labels: # This value must be privileged for the controller to run successfully. pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.25 # We are setting these to our _desired_ `enforce` level, but note that these below values can be any of the available options.

rke2-server 你也可以通过传递 --service 标志来轮换单个服务，例如：rke2 certificate rotate --service api-server。 在 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests 中找到的任何文件都会以类似于 kubectl apply 的方式自动部署到 Kubernetes。 有关使用清单目录部署 Helm Chart 的信息，请参阅 Helm 章节。 RKE2 会在 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/etc/containerd/config.toml 中为 containerd 生成 config.toml。 如果要对这个文件进行高级定制，你可以在同一目录中创建另一个名为 config.toml.tmpl 的文件，此文件将会代替默认设置。 config.toml.tmpl 是一个 Go 模板文件，并且 config.Node 结构会被传递给模板。有关如何使用该结构自定义配置文件的示例，请参见此模板。 如果你运行 RKE2 的环境中只通过 HTTP 代理进行外部连接，你可以在 RKE2 的 systemd 服务上配置代理。RKE2 将使用这些代理设置，并向下传递到嵌入式 containerd 和 kubelet。 将必要的 HTTP_PROXY、HTTPS_PROXY 和 NO_PROXY 变量添加到 systemd 服务的环境文件中，通常是： /etc/default/rke2-server /etc/default/rke2-agent RKE2 会自动将集群内部 Pod 和 Service IP 范围以及集群 DNS 域添加到 NO_PROXY 条目列表中。你需要确保 Kubernetes 节点本身使用的 IP 地址范围（即节点的公共和私有 IP）包含在 NO_PROXY 列表中，或者可以通过代理访问节点。 HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 HTTPS_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16 如果你想在不影响 RKE2 和 Kubelet 的情况下为 containerd 配置代理，你可以在变量前加上 CONTAINERD_： CONTAINERD_HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 CONTAINERD_HTTPS_PROXY=http://your-proxy.example.com:8888 CONTAINERD_NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16 RKE2 Agent 可以通过 node-label 和 node-taint 选项来配置，它们会为 kubelet 添加标签和污点。这两个选项只能在注册时添加标签和/或污点，因此它们只能被添加一次，之后不能再通过运行 rke2 命令来移除。 如果你想在节点注册后更改节点标签和污点，你需要使用 kubectl。关于如何添加污点和节点标签的详细信息，请参阅官方 Kubernetes 文档。 Agent 节点通过 rke2 agent 进程发起的 WebSocket 连接进行注册，连接由作为 agent 进程一部分运行的客户端负载均衡器维护。 Agent 将使用 join token 的集群 Secret 以及随机生成的节点密码注册到 Server，密码存储在 /etc/rancher/node/password 中。Server 会将各个节点的密码存储为 Kubernetes Secret，后续的任何尝试都必须使用相同的密码。节点密码 Secret 存储在 kube-system 命名空间中，名称使用 .node-password.rke2 模板。当相应的 Kubernetes 节点被删除时，这些 Secret 也会被删除。 注意：在 RKE2 v1.20.2 之前，Server 将密码存储在磁盘上的 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/node-passwd 中。 如果 Agent 的 /etc/rancher/node 目录被删除，你需要在启动前为 Agent 重新创建密码文件，或者从 Server 或 Kubernetes 集群中删除该条目（取决于 RKE2版本）。 安装脚本为 systemd 提供了单元，但默认情况下不启用或启动该服务。 使用 systemd 运行时，日志将在 /var/log/syslog 中创建，你可以通过 journalctl -u rke2-server 或 journalctl -u rke2-agent 查看日志。 使用安装脚本安装的示例： curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sh - systemctl enable rke2-server systemctl start rke2-server 中国用户，可以使用以下方法加速安装： curl -sfL https://rancher-mirror.rancher.cn/rke2/install.sh | INSTALL_RKE2_MIRROR=cn sh - systemctl enable rke2-server systemctl start rke2-server 在集群引导期间与 rke2 绑在一起的 Server Chart 可以被禁用并替换。常见的用例是替换捆绑的 rke2-ingress-nginx Chart。 要禁用任何捆绑的系统 Chart，请在引导之前在配置文件中设置 disable 参数。要禁用的系统 Chart 完整列表： rke2-canal rke2-coredns rke2-ingress-nginx

/var/lib/rancher/rke2/data/${RKE2_DATA_KEY}/bin，其中 ${RKE2_DATA_KEY} 表示镜像的唯一字符串标识。 为了使 RKE2 按预期工作，运行时镜像必须至少提供： containerd (CRI) containerd-shim（如果 containerd 停止，shims wrap runc 任务并且不会随之停止） containerd-shim-runc-v1 containerd-shim-runc-v2 kubelet (Kubernetes node agent) runc (OCI runtime) 运行时镜像还提供了以下操作工具： ctr（底层 containerd 维护检查） crictl（底层 CRI 维护和检查） kubectl（kubernetes 集群维护检查）

参数自行进行配置。 快照是默认启动的。 快照目录默认为 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/snapshots。 要配置快照间隔或保留快照的数量，请参阅选项。 在 RKE2 中，快照会存储在每个 etcd 节点上。如果你有多个 etcd 或 etcd + control plane 节点，你将拥有本地 etcd 快照的多个副本。 你可以在 RKE2 运行时使用 etcd-snapshot 子命令手动执行快照。例如：rke2 etcd-snapshot save --name pre-upgrade-snapshot。 RKE2 启用了一项功能，可以通过传递 --cluster-reset 标志将集群重置为一个成员集群。将此标志传递给 RKE2 server 时，它将使用相同的数据目录重置集群，数据 etcd 的目录存在于 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd 中，这个标志可以在集群丢失仲裁时传递。 要传递重置标志，首先你需要停止 RKE2 服务（如果 RKE2 是通过 systemd 启用的）： systemctl stop rke2-server rke2 server --cluster-reset 结果：日志中的一条消息表示 RKE2 可以在没有标志的情况下重新启动。再次启动 RKE2，它应该将 RKE2 作为一个成员集群启动。 使用备份恢复 RKE2 时，旧的数据目录将被移动到 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd-old-%date%/。然后 RKE2 将尝试通过创建一个新的数据目录来恢复快照，并使用一个具有一个 etcd 成员的新 RKE2 集群启动 etcd。 如果通过 systemd 启用，则必须在所有 Server 节点上停止 RKE2 服务。使用以下命令执行此操作： systemctl stop rke2-server 接下来，使用以下命令在第一个 Server 节点上启动快照恢复： rke2 server \\ --cluster-reset \\ --cluster-reset-restore-path= 恢复完成后，在第一个 Server 节点上启动 rke2-server 服务，如下所示： systemctl start rke2-server 删除其他 Server 节点上的 rke2 db 目录，如下： rm -rf /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db 使用以下命令在其他 Server 节点上启动 rke2-server 服务： systemctl start rke2-server 结果：成功恢复后，日志中的一条消息表明 etcd 正在运行，RKE2 可以在没有标志的情况下重启。再次启动 RKE2，RKE2 应该会成功运行并通过指定的快照恢复。 RKE2 重置集群时会在 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/reset-flag 中创建一个空文件。该文件留在原地是没有问题的，但必须删除它才能执行后续的重置或恢复。RKE2 正常启动时会删除该文件。 警告：对于 rke2 v.1.20.9 及之前的所有版本，由于存在一个已知问题，即引导数据可能无法在恢复时保存（步骤 1 -下面的 3 假定了这种情况），因此你需要先备份和恢复证书。请参阅下面的注意事项，了解特定版本的恢复注意事项。 备份 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred、/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls、/var /lib/rancher/rke2/server/token 和 /etc/rancher 将上面步骤 1 中的证书恢复到第一个新 Server 节点。 在第一个新 Server 节点上安装 rke2 v1.20.8+rke2r1，如下所示： curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=\"v1.20.8+rke2r1\" sh - 如果 RKE2 已启用，请停止所有 Server 节点上的 RKE2 服务，并使用以下命令在第一个 Server 节点上启动快照恢复： systemctl stop rke2-server rke2 server \\ --cluster-reset \\ --cluster-reset-restore-path= 恢复完成后，在第一个 Server 节点上启动 rke2-server 服务，如下所示： systemctl start rke2-server 你可以根据标准 RKE2 HA 安装文档继续向集群添加新的 Server 和 Worker 节点。 执行备份恢复时，用户不需要使用创建快照时使用的 RKE2 版本。用户可以使用更新的版本进行恢复。如果你在恢复时更改版本，请注意正在使用哪个 etcd 版本。 快照默认启用，并且每 12 小时获取一次。快照写入到 ${data-dir}/server/db/snapshots，默认 ${data-dir} 为 /var/lib/rancher /rke2。 使用备份将 RKE2 恢复到使用 rke2 v1.20.11+rke2r1 的新节点时，请运行 rke2-killall.sh 确保所有 pod 在初始恢复后已停止，如下所示： curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=v1.20.11+rke2r1 rke2 server \\ --cluster-reset \\ --cluster-reset-restore-path= \\ --token= rke2-killall.sh 恢复完成后，在第一个 Server 节点上启动 rke2-server 服务，如下所示： systemctl enable rke2-server systemctl start rke2-server 这些选项可以在配置文件中设置： 选项 描述 etcd-disable-snapshots 禁用自动 etcd 快照 etcd-snapshot-schedule-cron value cron 规范中的快照间隔时间。eg. 每 4 小时 0 */4 * * *（默认值：0 */12 * * *）

Helm CRD 使用 HelmChartConfig 自定义打包组件 在 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests 中找到的 Kubernetes 清单都会以类似于 kubectl apply 的方式自动部署到 RKE2。以这种方式部署的清单作为 AddOn 自定义资源进行管理，你可以通过运行 kubectl get addon -A

资源定义捕获了你通常传递给 helm 命令行工具的大部分选项。以下示例说明了如何从默认 Chart 仓库部署 Grafana，并覆盖某些默认的 Chart 值。请注意，HelmChart 资源本身位于 kube-system 命名空间中，但 Chart 的资源将部署到 monitoring 命名空间。 apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChart

RKE2 问题，请https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues[提交一个新 issue]。 Firewalld 与 RKE2 的默认 Canal（Calico + Flannel）网络堆栈冲突。为避免意外，请在运行 RKE2 的系统上禁用 firewalld。 NetworkManager 会控制默认网络命名空间中接口的路由表，其中许多 CNI（包括 RKE2 的默认 CNI）会为连接到容器而创建 veth 对。这会干扰 CNI 进行正确路由。因此，如果在启用 NetworkManager 的系统上安装 RKE2，强烈建议你将 NetworkManager 配置为忽略 calico/flannel 相关的网络接口。为此，在 /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d 中创建名为 rke2-canal.conf 的配置文件，内容如下： [keyfile] unmanaged-devices=interface-name:cali*;interface-name:flannel* 如果你还没有安装 RKE2，使用简单的 systemctl reload NetworkManager 就足以安装配置。如果在已安装 RKE2 的系统上执行此配置更改，则需要重启节点才能应用更改。 在某些操作系统（如 RHEL 8.4）中，NetworkManager 包含两个额外的服务，分别称为 nm-cloud-setup.service 和 nm-cloud-setup.timer。这些服务增加了一个路由表，干扰了 CNI 插件的配置。但是，现在没有可以避免这种情况的任何配置，如https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues[问题]中所述。因此，如果存在这些服务，则应将其禁用。 在 NetworkManager-1.30.0-11.el8_4 之前，节点也必须在禁用额外服务后重启。 这是由 RKE2 的实时内核模块加载导致的，除非容器具有特权，否则在 Selinux 下不允许这样做。 要让 Istio 在这些条件下运行，需要两个步骤： 启用 CNI 作为 Istio 安装的一部分。请注意，此功能在撰写本文时仍处于 Alpha 状态。 确保 values.cni.cniBinDir=/opt/cni/bin 和 values.cni.cniConfDir=/etc/cni/net.d 安装完成后，CrashLoopBackoff 中应该有 cni-node pod。手动编辑他们的守护进程以在 install-cni 容器中包含 securityContext.privileged: true。 这可以通过自定义覆盖来执行，如下所示： apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1 kind: IstioOperator spec: components: cni: enabled: true k8s: overlays: - apiVersion: \"apps/v1\" kind: \"DaemonSet\" name: \"istio-cni-node\" patches: - path:

logLevel: info cniBinDir: /opt/cni/bin cniConfDir: /etc/cni/net.d 有关不遵循这些步骤时故障的详细日志，请参阅 issue 504。 RKE2 v1.19.5+ 内置 containerd v1.4.x 或更高版本，因此应该在支持 cgroups v2 的系统上运行。 旧版本 (< 1.19.5) 内置 containerd 1.3.x 分支（从 1.4.x 向后移植 SELinux commits），它不支持 cgroups v2，需要一些前期配置： 假设使用基于 systemd 的系统，设置 https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html#systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy 内核参数将向 systemd 表明它应该以混合 (cgroups v1 + v2) 方式运行。 结合上述情况，设置 systemd.legacy_systemd_cgroup_controller 内核参数将向 systemd 表明它应该以旧版（cgroups v1）的方式运行。 由于这些参数是内核命令行参数，因此必须在系统引导程序中设置，以便在 /sbin/init 作为 PID 1 传递给 systemd。 参阅： grub2 手册 systemd 手册 cgroups v2 在使用 vxlan 封装以及启用了 vxlan 接口的校验和卸载时，Calico 遇到了一个内核错误。 calico 项目 和 rke2项目中描述了该问题。我们的临时解决方法是，在 calico helm chart 中使用 ChecksumOffloadBroken=true 的值，从而默认禁用校验和卸载。 此问题已在 Ubuntu 18.04、Ubuntu 20.04 和 openSUSE Leap 15.3 中发现。 Wicked 根据 sysctl 配置文件（例如 /etc/sysctl.d/ 目录下）配置主机的网络设置。即使 RKE2 正在将 /net/ipv4/conf/all/forwarding 之类的参数设置为 1，但是只要重新应用网络配置（有几个事件会导致网络配置重新应用以及 rcwicked 在更新期间重启），Wicked 就可以恢复该配置。因此，在 sysctl 配置文件中启用 ipv4（和双栈情况下的 ipv6）转发非常重要。例如，建议创建一个名为 /etc/sysctl.d/90-rke2.conf 的文件，文件包含以下参数（仅在双栈下才需要 ipv6）： net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 两个可能的原因如下： iptables 二进制文件未安装在主机中，并且有一个定义 hostPort 的 pod。Pod 将获得一个 IP，但它的创建将失败，而且 Kubernetes 不会停止尝试重新创建它，每次尝试都会消耗一个 IP。containerd 日志中会出现类似如下的错误信息。这是显示错误的日志： plugin type=\"portmap\" failed (add): failed to open iptables: exec: \"iptables\": executable file not found in $PATH 请安装 iptables 或 xtables-nft 包来解决这个问题 默认情况下，Canal 通过在 /var/lib/cni/networks/k8s-pod-network 中为每个 IP 创建一个锁定文件来跟踪 pod IP。每个 IP 都属于一个 pod，一旦 pod 被删除，IP 就会被删除。然而，万一 containerd 无法跟踪正在运行的 pod，锁定文件可能会泄露，Canal 将无法再重用这些 IP。如果发生这种情况，你可能会遇到 IP 地址枯竭的错误，例如： failed to allocate for range 0: no IP addresses available in range set 有两种方法可以解决这个问题。你可以从该目录中手动删除未使用的 IP 或清空节点，运行 rke2-killall.sh，启动 rke2 systemd 服务并取消对节点的封锁。如果你需要执行这些操作，请通过 GitHub 报告问题，请确保说明问题是如何触发的。 默认情况下，当 RKE2 使用由 profile 参数选择的 CIS 配置文件运行时，它会应用可以限制 Ingress 的网络策略。此外，rke2-ingress-nginx chart 的默认设置为 hostNetwork: false，因此，用户需要设置自己的网络策略来允许访问 Ingress URL。以下是一个网络策略示例，该示例允许进入它所应用的命名空间中的任何工作负载。有关更多配置选项，请参阅https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[此处]。 apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata: name:

Standard（PSS）。你可以在https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/[上游文档]中阅读有关 PSS 的更多信息。对于 RKE2，如果在节点上设置了 profile 标志，则必须手动执行一些步骤。 在所有节点上，将 profile 值更新为 cis-1.23，但不要重启或升级 RKE2。

If your nodes do not have an interface with a default route, a default route must be configured; even a black-hole route via a dummy interface will suffice. RKE2 requires a default route in order to auto-detect the node’s primary IP, and for kube-proxy ClusterIP routing to function properly. To add a dummy route, do the following: ip link add dummy0 type dummy ip link set dummy0 up ip addr add 203.0.113.254/31 dev dummy0 ip route add default via 203.0.113.255 dev dummy0 metric 1000 Download the airgap images tarballs from the RKE release artifacts list for the version and platform of RKE2 you are using. Use rke2-images.linux-amd64.tar.zst, or rke2-images.linux-amd64.tar.gz for releases prior to v1.20. Zstandard offers better compression ratios and faster decompression speeds compared to gzip. If using the default Canal CNI (--cni=canal), you can use either the rke2-image legacy archive as described above, or rke2-images-core and rke2-images-canal archives. If using the alternative Cilium CNI (--cni=cilium), you must download the rke2-images-core and rke2-images-cilium archives instead. If using your own CNI (--cni=none), you can download only the rke2-images-core archive. If enabling the vSphere CPI/CSI charts (--cloud-provider-name=rancher-vsphere), you must also download the rke2-images-vsphere archive. Ensure that the /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/ directory exists on the node. Copy the compressed archive to /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/ on the node, ensuring that the file extension is retained. Install RKE2. As of RKE2 v1.20, private registry support honors all settings from the containerd registry configuration. This includes endpoint override and transport protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), authentication, certificate verification, etc. Prior to RKE2 v1.20, private registries must use TLS, with a cert trusted by the host CA bundle. If the registry is using a self-signed cert, you can add the cert to the host CA bundle with update-ca-certificates. The registry must also allow anonymous (unauthenticated) access. Add all the required system images to your private registry. A list of images can be obtained from the .txt file corresponding to each tarball referenced above, or you may docker load the airgap image tarballs, then tag and push the loaded images. If using a private or self-signed certificate on the registry, add the registry’s CA cert to the containerd registry configuration, or operating system’s trusted certs for releases prior to v1.20. Install RKE2 using the system-default-registry parameter, or use the containerd registry configuration to use your registry as a mirror for docker.io. The following options to install RKE2 should only be performed after completing one of either the Tarball Method or Private Registry Method. RKE2 can be installed either by running the binary directly or by using the install.sh script. Obtain the RKE2 binary file rke2.linux-amd64. Ensure the binary is named rke2 and place it in /usr/local/bin. Ensure it is executable. Run the binary with the desired parameters. For example, if using the Private Registry Method, your config file would have the following: system-default-registry: \"registry.example.com:5000\" The system-default-registry parameter must specify only valid RFC 3986 URI authorities, i.e. a host and optional port. install.sh may be used in an offline mode by setting the INSTALL_RKE2_ARTIFACT_PATH variable to a path containing pre-downloaded artifacts. This will run though a normal install, including creating systemd units. Download the install script, rke2, rke2-images, and sha256sum archives from the release into a directory, as in the example below: mkdir /root/rke2-artifacts && cd /root/rke2-artifacts/ curl -OLs https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.26.10%2Brke2r2/rke2-images.linux-amd64.tar.zst curl -OLs https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.26.10%2Brke2r2/rke2.linux-amd64.tar.gz curl -OLs https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases/download/v1.26.10%2Brke2r2/sha256sum-amd64.txt curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io --output install.sh Next, run install.sh using the directory, as in the example below: INSTALL_RKE2_ARTIFACT_PATH=/root/rke2-artifacts sh install.sh Enable and run the service as outlined here.","title":"Air-Gap Install","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"airgap","url":"/rke2/latest/en/install/airgap.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Tarball Method","hash":"_tarball_method","id":2},{"text":"Private Registry Method","hash":"_private_registry_method","id":3},{"text":"Install RKE2","hash":"_install_rke2","id":4},{"text":"RKE2 Binary Install","hash":"_rke2_binary_install","id":5},{"text":"RKE2 Install.sh Script Install","hash":"_rke2_install_sh_script_install","id":6}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"The primary way to configure RKE2 is through its config file. Command line arguments and environment variables are also available, but RKE2 is installed as a systemd service and thus these are not as easy to leverage. By default, RKE2 will launch with the values present in the YAML file located at /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml. The RKE2 config file needs to be created manually. You can do that by running touch /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml as a privileged user. If the configuration is changed after starting RKE2, the service must be restarted to apply the new configuration. An example of a basic server config file is below: write-kubeconfig-mode: \"0644\" tls-san: - \"foo.local\" node-label: - \"foo=bar\" - \"something=amazing\" debug: true The configuration file parameters map directly to CLI arguments, with repeatable CLI arguments being represented as YAML lists. Boolean flags are represented as true or false in the YAML file. An identical configuration using solely CLI arguments is shown below to demonstrate this: rke2 server \\ --write-kubeconfig-mode \"0644\" \\ --tls-san \"foo.local\" \\ --node-label \"foo=bar\" \\ --node-label \"something=amazing\" \\ --debug It is also possible to use both a configuration file and CLI arguments. In these situations, values will be loaded from both sources, but CLI arguments will take precedence. For repeatable arguments such as --node-label, the CLI arguments will overwrite all values in the list. Finally, the location of the config file can be changed either through the cli argument --config FILE, -c FILE, or the environment variable $RKE2_CONFIG_FILE. Version Gate Available as of v1.21.2+rke2r1. Multiple configuration files are supported. By default, configuration files are read from /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml and /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml.d/*.yaml in alphabetical order. By default, the last value found for a given key will be used. A ` can be appended to the key to append the value to the existing string or slice, instead of replacing it. All occurrences of this key in subsequent files will also require a ` to prevent overwriting the accumulated value. An example of multiple config files is below: # config.yaml token: boop node-label: - foo=bar - bar=baz # config.yaml.d/test1.yaml write-kubeconfig-mode: 600 node-taint: - alice=bob:NoExecute # config.yaml.d/test2.yaml write-kubeconfig-mode: 777 node-label: - other=what - foo=three node-taint+: - charlie=delta:NoSchedule This results in a final configuration of: write-kubeconfig-mode: 777 token: boop node-label: - other=what - foo=three node-taint: - alice=bob:NoExecute - charlie=delta:NoSchedule As mentioned in the Quick Start Guide, you can use the installation script available at https://get.rke2.io to install RKE2 as a service. The simplest form of this command is running, as root user or through sudo, as follows: # curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo sh - curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sh - When using this method to install RKE2, the following environment variables can be used to configure the installation: Environment Variable Description INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION Version of RKE2 to download from GitHub. Will attempt to download the latest release from the stable channel if not specified. INSTALL_RKE2_CHANNEL should also be set if installing on an RPM-based system and the desired version does not exist in the stable channel. INSTALL_RKE2_TYPE Type of systemd service to create, can be either \"server\" or \"agent\" Default is \"server\". INSTALL_RKE2_CHANNEL_URL Channel URL for fetching RKE2 download URL. Defaults to https://update.rke2.io/v1-release/channels. INSTALL_RKE2_CHANNEL Channel to use for fetching RKE2 download URL. Defaults to stable. Options include: stable, latest, testing. INSTALL_RKE2_METHOD Method of installation to use. Default is on RPM-based systems rpm, all else tar. This installation script is straight-forward and will do the following: Obtain the desired version to install based on the above parameters. If no parameters are supplied, the latest official release will be used. Determine and execute the installation method. There are two methods: rpm and tar. If the INSTALL_RKE2_METHOD variable is set, that will be respected, Otherwise, rpm will be used on operating systems that use this package management system. On all other systems, tar will be used. In the case of the tar method, the script will simply unpack the tar archive associated with the desired release. In the case of rpm, a yum repository will be set up and the rpm will be installed using yum. Windows Support requires choosing Calico or Flannel as the CNI for the RKE2 cluster As mentioned in the Quick-Start Guide, you can use the installation script available at https://github.com/rancher/rke2/blob/master/install.ps1 to install RKE2 on a Windows Agent Node. The simplest form of this command is as follows: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/rke2/master/install.ps1 -Outfile install.ps1 When using this method to install the Windows RKE2 agent, the following parameters can be passed to configure the installation script: SYNTAX install.ps1 [[-Channel] ] [[-Method] ] [[-Type] ] [[-Version] ] [[-TarPrefix] ] [-Commit] [[-AgentImagesDir] ] [[-ArtifactPath] ] [[-ChannelUrl] ] [] OPTIONS -Channel Channel to use for fetching RKE2 download URL (Default: \"stable\") -Method The installation method to use. Currently tar or choco installation supported. (Default: \"tar\") -Type Type of RKE2 service. Only the \"agent\" type is supported on Windows. (Default: \"agent\") -Version Version of RKE2 to download from Github -TarPrefix Installation prefix when using the tar installation method. (Default: `C:/usr/local` unless `C:/usr/local` is read-only or has a dedicated mount point, in which case `C:/opt/rke2` is used instead) -Commit (experimental/agent) Commit of RKE2 to download from temporary cloud storage. If set, this forces `--Method=tar`. Intended for development purposes only. -AgentImagesDir Installation path for airgap images when installing from CI commit. (Default: `C:/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images`) -ArtifactPath If set, the install script will use the local path for sourcing the `rke2.windows-$SUFFIX` and `sha256sum-$ARCH.txt` files rather than the downloading the files from GitHub.

Upon startup, RKE2 will check to see if a registries.yaml file exists at /etc/rancher/rke2/ and instruct containerd to use any registries defined in the file. If you wish to use a private registry, then you will need to create this file as root on each node that will be using the registry. Server nodes are schedulable by default. If you have not tainted the server nodes and will be running workloads on them, please ensure you also create the registries.yaml file on each server as well. Prior to RKE2 v1.20, containerd registry configuration is not honored for the initial RKE2 node bootstrapping, only for Kubernetes workloads that are launched after the node is joined to the cluster. Consult the airgap installation documentation if you plan on using this containerd registry feature to bootstrap nodes. Configuration in containerd can be used to connect to a private registry with a TLS connection and with registries that enable authentication as well. The following section will explain the registries.yaml file and give different examples of using private registry configuration in RKE2. The file consists of two main sections: mirrors configs Mirrors is a directive that defines the names and endpoints of the private registries. Private registries can be used as a local mirror for the default docker.io registry, or for images where the registry is explicitly specified in the name. For example, the following configuration would pull from the private registry at https://registry.example.com:5000 for both library/busybox:latest and registry.example.com/library/busybox:latest: mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" registry.example.com: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" Each mirror must have a name and set of endpoints. When pulling an image from a registry, containerd will try these endpoint URLs one by one, and use the first working one. If no endpoint is configured, containerd assumes that the registry can be accessed anonymously via HTTPS on port 443, and is using a certificate trusted by the host operating system. For more information, you may consult the containerd documentation. Each mirror can have a set of rewrites. Rewrites can change the tag of an image based on a regular expression. This is useful if the organization/project structure in the mirror registry is different to the upstream one. For example, the following configuration would transparently pull the image rancher/rke2-runtime:v1.23.5-rke2r1 from registry.example.com:5000/mirrorproject/rancher-images/rke2-runtime:v1.23.5-rke2r1: mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" rewrite: \"^rancher/(.*)\": \"mirrorproject/rancher-images/$1\" The configs section defines the TLS and credential configuration for each mirror. For each mirror you can define auth and/or tls. The TLS part consists of: Directive Description cert_file The client certificate path that will be used to authenticate with the registry key_file The client key path that will be used to authenticate with the registry ca_file Defines the CA certificate path to be used to verify the registry’s server cert file insecure_skip_verify Boolean that defines if TLS verification should be skipped for the registry The credentials consist of either username/password or authentication token: username: user name of the private registry basic auth password: user password of the private registry basic auth auth: authentication token of the private registry basic auth Below are basic examples of using private registries in different modes: Below are examples showing how you may configure /etc/rancher/rke2/registries.yaml on each node when using TLS. With Authentication: mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" configs: \"registry.example.com:5000\": auth: username: xxxxxx # this is the registry username password: xxxxxx # this is the registry password tls: cert_file: # path to the cert file used to authenticate to the registry key_file: # path to the key file for the certificate used to authenticate to the registry ca_file: # path to the ca file used to verify the registry's certificate insecure_skip_verify: # may be set to true to skip verifying the registry's certificate Without Authentication: mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" configs: \"registry.example.com:5000\": tls: cert_file: # path to the cert file used to authenticate to the registry key_file: # path to the key file for the certificate used to authenticate to the registry ca_file: # path to the ca file used to verify the registry's certificate insecure_skip_verify: # may be set to true to skip verifying the registry's certificate Below are examples showing how you may configure /etc/rancher/rke2/registries.yaml on each node when not using TLS. Plaintext HTTP With Authentication: mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"http://registry.example.com:5000\" configs: \"registry.example.com:5000\": auth: username: xxxxxx # this is the registry username password: xxxxxx # this is the registry password Plaintext HTTP Without Authentication: mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"http://registry.example.com:5000\" If using a registry using plaintext HTTP without TLS, you need to specify http:// as the endpoint URI scheme, otherwise it will default to https://. In order for the registry changes to take effect, you need to either configure this file before starting RKE2 on the node, or restart RKE2 on each configured node.","title":"Containerd Registry Configuration","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"containerd_registry_configuration","url":"/rke2/latest/en/install/containerd_registry_configuration.html","titles":[{"text":"Registries Configuration File","hash":"_registries_configuration_file","id":1},{"text":"Mirrors","hash":"_mirrors","id":2},{"text":"Rewrites","hash":"_rewrites","id":3},{"text":"Configs","hash":"_configs","id":4},{"text":"With TLS","hash":"_with_tls","id":5},{"text":"Without TLS","hash":"_without_tls","id":6}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"This section describes how to install a high availability (HA) RKE2 cluster. An HA RKE2 cluster consists of: A fixed registration address that is placed in front of server nodes to allow other nodes to register with the cluster. An odd number (three recommended) of server nodes that will run etcd, the Kubernetes API, and other control plane services. Zero or more agent nodes that are designated to run your apps and services. Why An Odd Number Of Server Nodes? An etcd cluster must be comprised of an odd number of server nodes for etcd to maintain quorum. For a cluster with n servers, quorum is (n/2)+1. For any odd-sized cluster, adding one node will always increase the number of nodes necessary for quorum. Although adding a node to an odd-sized cluster appears better since there are more machines, the fault tolerance is worse. Exactly the same number of nodes can fail without losing quorum, but there are now more nodes that can fail. Agents register through the fixed registration address. However, when RKE2 launches the kubelet and it must connect to the Kubernetes api-server, it does so through the rke2 agent process, which acts as a client-side load balancer. Setting up an HA cluster requires the following steps: Configure a fixed registration address Launch the first server node Join additional server nodes Join agent nodes Server nodes beyond the first one and all agent nodes need a URL to register against. This can be the IP or hostname of any of the server nodes, but in many cases those may change over time as nodes are created and destroyed. Therefore, you should have a stable endpoint in front of the server nodes. This endpoint can be set up using any number approaches, such as: A layer 4 (TCP) load balancer Round-robin DNS Virtual or elastic IP addresses This endpoint can also be used for accessing the Kubernetes API. So you can, for example, modify your kubeconfig file to point to it instead of a specific node. Note that the rke2 server process listens on port 9345 for new nodes to register. The Kubernetes API is served on port 6443, as normal. Configure your load balancer accordingly. The first server node establishes the secret token that other server or agent nodes will register with when connecting to the cluster. To specify your own pre-shared secret as the token, set the token argument on startup. If you do not specify a pre-shared secret, RKE2 will generate one and place it at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/node-token. To avoid certificate errors with the fixed registration address, you should launch the server with the tls-san parameter set. This option adds an additional hostname or IP as a Subject Alternative Name in the server’s TLS cert, and it can be specified as a list if you would like to access via both the IP and the hostname. Example of RKE2 config file for first server: The RKE2 config file needs to be created manually. You can do that by running touch /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml as a privileged user. token: my-shared-secret tls-san: - my-kubernetes-domain.com - another-kubernetes-domain.com By default, server nodes will be schedulable and thus your workloads can get launched on them. If you wish to have a dedicated control plane where no user workloads will run, you can use taints. The node-taint parameter will allow you to configure nodes with taints. Here is an example of adding a node taint to the configuration file: node-taint: - \"CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute\" The NGINX Ingress and Metrics Server addons will not be deployed when all nodes are tainted with CriticalAddonsOnly. If your server nodes are so tainted, these addons will remain pending until untainted agent nodes are added to the cluster. Additional server nodes are launched much like the first, except that you must specify the server and token parameters so that they can successfully connect to the initial server node. Matching Flags It is important to match critical flags on your server nodes. For example, if you use the flag --cluster-cidr=10.200.0.0/16 on your first server node, but don’t set it on other server nodes, the nodes will fail to join. They will print errors such as: failed to validate server configuration: critical configuration value mismatch. See Server Configuration for more information on which flags must be set identically on server nodes. Example of RKE2 config file for additional server nodes: server: https://my-kubernetes-domain.com:9345 token: my-shared-secret tls-san: - my-kubernetes-domain.com - another-kubernetes-domain.com As mentioned previously, you must have an odd number of server nodes in total. If an etcd datastore is found on disk either because that node has either initialized or joined a cluster already, the argument --server is ignored. Once you’ve launched the rke2 server process on all server nodes, ensure that the cluster has come up properly with: /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get nodes \\ --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml You should see your server nodes in the Ready state. By default, any kubectl command will require root user access, unless RKE2_KUBECONFIG_MODE override is provided. Read more about it in cluster access page. Because RKE2 server nodes are schedulable by default, the minimum number of nodes for an HA RKE2 server cluster is three server nodes and zero agent nodes. To add nodes designated to run your apps and services, join agent nodes to your cluster. Joining agent nodes in an HA cluster is the same as joining agent nodes in a single server cluster. You just need to specify the URL the agent should register to and the token it should use. server: https://my-kubernetes-domain.com:9345 token: my-shared-secret","title":"High Availability","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"ha","url":"/rke2/latest/en/install/ha.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

RKE2 can be installed to a system in a number of ways, two of which are the preferred and supported methods. Those methods are tarball and RPM. The install script referenced in the Quick Start is a wrapper around these two methods. This document explains these installation methods in greater detail. To install RKE2 via install you first need to get the install script. This can be done in a number of ways. This gets the script and immediately starts the installation process. # curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sudo sh - curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sh - Alternatively, you can download the install script and make it executable. curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io --output install.sh chmod +x install.sh The installation process defaults to the latest RKE2 version and no other qualifiers are necessary. However, if you want to specify a version, you should set the INSTALL_RKE2_CHANNEL environment variable. An example below: INSTALL_RKE2_CHANNEL=latest ./install.sh When the install script is executed, it makes a determination of what type of system it is. If it’s an OS that uses RPMs (such as CentOS or RHEL), it will perform an RPM based installation, otherwise the script defaults to tarball. RPM based installation is covered below. Next, the installation script downloads the tarball, verifies it by comparing SHA256 hashes, and lastly, extracts the contents to /usr/local. An operator is free to move the files after installation if desired. This operation simply extracts the tarball and no other system modifications are made. Tarball structure / contents bin - contains the RKE2 executable as well as the rke2-killall.sh and rke2-uninstall.sh scripts lib - contains server and agent systemd unit files share - contains the RKE2 license as well as a sysctl configuration file used for when RKE2 is ran in CIS mode To configure the system any further, you’ll want to reference either the server or agent documentation. To start the RPM install process, you need to get the installation script which is covered above. The script will check your system for rpm, yum, or dnf and if any of those exist, it determines that the system is Redhat based and starts the RPM install process. Files are installed with the prefix of /usr rather than /usr/local. Signed RPMs are published for RKE2 within the rpm-testing.rancher.io and rpm.rancher.io RPM repositories. If you run the https://get.rke2.io script on nodes supporting RPMs, it will use these RPM repos by default. But you can also install them yourself. The RPMs provide systemd units for managing rke2, but will need to be configured via configuration file before starting the services for the first time. In order to use the RPM repository, on a CentOS or RHEL system, run the following bash snippet: export RKE2_MINOR=28 export LINUX_MAJOR=7 # or 8 or 9 etc cat /etc/yum.repos.d/rancher-rke2-1-${RKE2_MINOR}-latest.repo [rancher-rke2-common-latest] name=Rancher RKE2 Common Latest baseurl=https://rpm.rancher.io/rke2/latest/common/centos/${LINUX_MAJOR}/noarch enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key [rancher-rke2-1-${RKE2_MINOR}-latest] name=Rancher RKE2 1.${RKE2_MINOR} Latest baseurl=https://rpm.rancher.io/rke2/latest/1.${RKE2_MINOR}/centos/${LINUX_MAJOR}/x86_64 enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key EOF After the repository is configured, you can run either of the following commands: yum -y install rke2-server or yum -y install rke2-agent The RPM will install a corresponding rke2-server.service or rke2-agent.service systemd unit that can be invoked like: systemctl start rke2-server. Make sure that you configure rke2 before you start it, by following the Configuration File instructions below. The RKE2 binary is statically compiled and linked which allows for the RKE2 binary to be portable across Linux distributions without the concern for dependency issues. The simplest installation is to download the binary, make sure it’s executable, and copy it into the ${PATH}, generally /usr/local/bin. After first execution, RKE2 will create all necessary directories and files. To configure the system any further, you’ll want to reference the config file documentation.","title":"Installation Methods","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"methods","url":"/rke2/latest/en/install/methods.html","titles":[{"text":"Tarball","hash":"_tarball","id":1},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation","id":2},{"text":"RPM","hash":"_rpm","id":3},{"text":"Repositories","hash":"_repositories","id":4},{"text":"Enterprise Linux 7/8/9","hash":"_enterprise_linux_789","id":5},{"text":"Installation","hash":"_installation_2","id":6},{"text":"Manual","hash":"_manual","id":7}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"This guide will help you quickly launch a cluster with default options.

For SUSE® Rancher Prime: RKE2 versions 1.21 and higher, if the host kernel supports AppArmor, the AppArmor tools (usually available via the apparmor-parser package) must also be present prior to installing SUSE® Rancher Prime: RKE2. The SUSE® Rancher Prime: RKE2 installation process must be run as the root user or through sudo. SUSE® Rancher Prime: RKE2 provides an installation script that is a convenient way to install it as a service on systemd based systems. This script is available at https://get.rke2.io. To install SUSE® Rancher Prime: RKE2 using this method do the following: Run the installer curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sh - This will install the rke2-server service and the rke2 binary onto your machine. Due to its nature, It will fail unless it runs as the root user or through sudo. Enable the rke2-server service systemctl enable rke2-server.service Start the service systemctl start rke2-server.service Follow the logs, if you like journalctl -u rke2-server -f After running this installation: The rke2-server service will be installed. The rke2-server service will be configured to automatically restart after node reboots or if the process crashes or is killed. Additional utilities will be installed at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/. They include: kubectl, crictl, and ctr. Note that these are not on your path by default. Two cleanup scripts, rke2-killall.sh and rke2-uninstall.sh, will be installed to the path at: /usr/local/bin for regular file systems /opt/rke2/bin for read-only and brtfs file systems INSTALL_RKE2_TAR_PREFIX/bin if INSTALL_RKE2_TAR_PREFIX is set A kubeconfig file will be written to /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml. A token that can be used to register other server or agent nodes will be created at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/node-token If you are adding additional server nodes, you must have an odd number in total. An odd number is needed to maintain quorum. See the High Availability documentation for more details. The steps on this section requires root level access or sudo to work. Run the installer curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_TYPE=\"agent\" sh - This will install the rke2-agent service and the rke2 binary onto your machine. Due to its nature, It will fail unless it runs as the root user or through sudo. Enable the rke2-agent service systemctl enable rke2-agent.service Configure the rke2-agent service mkdir -p /etc/rancher/rke2/ vim /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml Content for config.yaml: server: https://:9345 token: The rke2 server process listens on port 9345 for new nodes to register. The Kubernetes API is still served on port 6443, as normal. Start the service systemctl start rke2-agent.service Follow the logs, if you like journalctl -u rke2-agent -f Each machine must have a unique hostname. If your machines do not have unique hostnames, set the node-name parameter in the config.yaml file and provide a value with a valid and unique hostname for each node. To read more about the config.yaml file, see the Install Options documentation. Windows Support works with Calico or Flannel as the CNI for the RKE2 cluster Prepare the Windows Agent Node The Windows Server Containers feature needs to be enabled for the RKE2 agent to work. Open a new Powershell window with Administrator privileges powershell -Command \"Start-Process PowerShell -Verb RunAs\" In the new Powershell window, run the following command to install the containers feature.

Hardware requirements scale based on the size of your deployments. Minimum recommendations are outlined here. RAM: 4GB Minimum (we recommend at least 8GB) CPU: 2 Minimum (we recommend at least 4CPU) When limited on CPU and RAM on the control-plane + etcd nodes, there could be limitations for the amount of agent nodes that can be joined under standard workload conditions. Server CPU Server RAM Number of Agents 2 4 GB 0-225 4 8 GB 226-450 8 16 GB 451-1300 16+ 32 GB 1300+ It is recommended to join agent nodes in batches of 50 or less to allow the CPU to free up space, as there is a spike on node join. Remember to modify the default cluster-cidr if desiring more than 255 nodes! This data was retrieved under specific test conditions. It will vary depending upon environment and workloads. The steps below give an overview of the test that was run to retrieve this. It was last performed on v1.27.4+rke2r1. All of the machines were provisioned in AWS with standard 20 GiB gp3 volumes. Monitor resources on grafana using prometheus data source. Deploy workloads in such a way to simulate continuous cluster activity: A basic workload that scales up and down continuously A workload that is deleted and recreated in a loop A constant workload that contains multiple other resources including CRDs. Join agent nodes in batches of 30-50 at a time. RKE2 performance depends on the performance of the database, and since RKE2 runs etcd embeddedly and it stores the data dir on disk, we recommend using an SSD when possible to ensure optimal performance. If your node has NetworkManager installed and enabled, ensure that it is configured to ignore CNI-managed interfaces. If your node has Wicked installed and enabled, ensure that the forwarding sysctl config is enabled. The RKE2 server needs port 6443 and 9345 to be accessible by other nodes in the cluster. All nodes need to be able to reach other nodes over UDP port 8472 when Flannel VXLAN is used. If you wish to utilize the metrics server, you will need to open port 10250 on each node. The VXLAN port on nodes should not be exposed to the world as it opens up your cluster network to be accessed by anyone. Run your nodes behind a firewall/security group that disables access to port 8472.

Install Windows RKE2. As of RKE2 v1.20, private registry support honors all settings from the containerd registry configuration. This includes endpoint override and transport protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), authentication, certificate verification, etc. Prior to RKE2 v1.20, private registries must use TLS, with a cert trusted by the host CA bundle. If the registry is using a self-signed cert, you can add the cert to the host CA bundle with update-ca-certificates. The registry must also allow anonymous (unauthenticated) access. Add all the required system images to your private registry. A list of images can be obtained from the .txt file corresponding to each tarball referenced above, or you may docker load the airgap image tarballs, then tag and push the loaded images. If using a private or self-signed certificate on the registry, add the registry’s CA cert to the containerd registry configuration, or operating system’s trusted certs for releases prior to v1.20. Install Windows RKE2 using the system-default-registry parameter, or use the containerd registry configuration to use your registry as a mirror for docker.io. These steps should only be performed after completing one of either the Tarball Method or Private Registry Method. Obtain the Windows RKE2 binary file rke2-windows-amd64.exe.

The Canal CNI plugin is the default but all CNI plugins are supported. All CNI plugins get installed via a helm chart after the main components are up and running and can be customized by modifying the helm chart options. RKE2 integrates with four different CNI plugins: Canal, Cilium, Calico and Flannel. Note that only Calico and Flannel are options for RKE2 deployments with Windows nodes. The next tabs inform how to deploy each CNI plugin and override the default options: Canal CNI plugin Cilium CNI plugin Calico CNI plugin Flannel CNI plugin Canal means using Flannel for inter-node traffic and Calico for intra-node traffic and network policies. By default, it will use vxlan encapsulation to create an overlay network among nodes. Canal is deployed by default in RKE2 and thus nothing must be configured to activate it. To override the default Canal options you should create a HelmChartConfig resource. The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart. For example to override the flannel interface, you can apply the following config: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- hubble: enabled: true relay: enabled: true ui: enabled: true Starting with RKE2 v1.23 it is possible to use flannel’s wireguard backend for in-kernel WireGuard encapsulation and encryption Users of kernels = 4.9.17) and they meet the requirements. To override the default options, please use a HelmChartConfig resource. The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart. For example, to enable eni: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- eni: enabled: true For more information about values available in the Cilium chart, please refer to the rke2-charts repository. Cilium includes advanced features to fully replace kube-proxy and implement the routing of services using eBPF instead of iptables. It is not recommended to replace kube-proxy by Cilium if your kernel is not v5.8 or newer, as important bug fixes and features will be missing. To activate this mode, deploy rke2 with the flag --disable-kube-proxy and the following cilium configuration: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- kubeProxyReplacement: true k8sServiceHost: k8sServicePort: For more information, please check the upstream docs. Cilium includes also an observability platform called Hubble.

To deploy Calico as the CNI plugin for RKE2 pass calico as the value of the --cni flag. To override the default options, please use a HelmChartConfig resource. The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart. For example, to change the mtu: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-calico-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-calico namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- installation: calicoNetwork: mtu: 9000 Because of a kernel bug in versions previous to 5.7, by default we are disabling the checksum offload done by the kernel. That config caps TCP performance to ~2.5Gbps. If you require higher throughput and have a kernel version greater than 5.7, you can enable the checksum offloading by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-calico-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-calico namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- felixConfiguration: featureDetectOverride: \"ChecksumOffloadBroken=false\" For more information about values available for the Calico chart, please refer to the rke2-charts repository. Calico requires the iptables or xtables-nft package to be installed on the node. Starting with RKE2 2024 Feb release (v1.29.2, v1.28.7, v1.27.11, v1.26.14), Flannel can be deployed as the CNI plugin. To do so, pass flannel as the value of the --cni flag. Only vxlan backend is supported at this point. Flannel does not support network policies. Therefore, it is not recommended for hardened installations. Flannel support in RKE2 is currently experimental. Do not run it on production systems before extensive testing. IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking enables the allocation of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services. To configure RKE2 in dual-stack mode, in the control-plane nodes, you must set a valid IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack cidr for pods and services. To do so, use the flags --cluster-cidr and --service-cidr for example: #/etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml cluster-cidr: \"10.42.0.0/16,2001:cafe:42::/56\" service-cidr: \"10.43.0.0/16,2001:cafe:43::/112\" Each CNI plugin may require a different configuration for dual-stack: Canal CNI plugin Cilium CNI plugin Calico CNI plugin Flannel CNI plugin Canal automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. Dual-stack is currently not supported in the windows installations of RKE2. Cilium automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. Calico automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. When deployed in dual-stack mode, it creates two different ippool resources. Note that when using dual-stack, calico leverages BGP instead of VXLAN encapsulation. Dual-stack and BGP are currently not supported in the windows installations of RKE2. Flannel automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. In case of IPv6 only configuration RKE2 needs to use localhost to access the liveness URL of the ETCD pod; check that your operating system configures /etc/hosts file correctly: ::1 localhost Some cloud providers, such as Linode, will create machines with localhost as the hostname and others may not have a hostname set at all. This can cause problems with domain name resolution. You can run RKE2 with the node-name parameter and this will pass the node name to resolve this issue.","title":"Network Options","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"basic_network_options","url":"/rke2/latest/en/networking/basic_network_options.html","titles":[{"text":"Install a CNI plugin","hash":"_install_a_cni_plugin","id":1},{"text":"Dual-stack configuration","hash":"_dual_stack_configuration","id":2},{"text":"IPv6 setup","hash":"_ipv6_setup","id":3},{"text":"Nodes Without a Hostname","hash":"_nodes_without_a_hostname","id":4}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"Multus CNI is a CNI plugin that enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. Multus does not replace CNI plugins, instead it acts as a CNI plugin multiplexer. Multus is useful in certain use cases, especially when pods are network intensive and require extra network interfaces that support dataplane acceleration techniques such as SR-IOV. Multus can not be deployed standalone. It always requires at least one conventional CNI plugin that fulfills the Kubernetes cluster network requirements. That CNI plugin becomes the default for Multus, and will be used to provide the primary interface for all pods. To enable Multus, add multus as the first list entry in the cni config key, followed by the name of the plugin you want to use alongside Multus (or none if you will provide your own default plugin). Note that multus must always be in the first position of the list. For example, to use Multus with canal as the default plugin you could specify: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml cni: - multus - canal This can also be specified with command-line arguments, i.e. --cni=multus,canal or --cni=multus --cni=canal. For more information about Multus, refer to the multus-cni documentation. To use Cilium with Multus the exclusive config needs to be disabled. You can do this by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- cni: exclusive: false Any CNI plugin can be used as secondary CNI plugin for Multus to provide additional network interfaces attached to a pod. However, it is most common to use the CNI plugins maintained by the containernetworking team (bridge, host-device, macvlan, etc) as secondary CNI plugins for Multus. These containernetworking plugins are automatically deployed when installing Multus. For more information about these plugins, refer to the containernetworking plugins documentation. To use any of these plugins, a proper NetworkAttachmentDefinition object will need to be created to define the configuration of the secondary network. The definition is then referenced by pod annotations, which Multus will use to provide extra interfaces to that pod. An example using the macvlan cni plugin with Multus is available in the multus-cni repo. host-local Multus DHCP daemon Whereabouts host-local IPAM plugin allocates ip addresses out of a set of address ranges. It stores the state locally on the host filesystem, therefore ensuring uniqueness of IP addresses on a single host. Therefore, we don’t recommend it for multi-node clusters. This IPAM plugin does not require any extra deployment. For more information: https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/ipam/host-local/. Multus provides an optional daemonset to deploy the DHCP daemon required to run the DHCP IPAM plugin. You can do this by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-multus-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-multus namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- manifests: dhcpDaemonSet: true This will configure the chart for Multus to deploy the DHCP daemonset. This feature is available starting with the 2024-01 releases (v1.29.1+rke2r1, v1.28.6+rke2r1, v1.27.10+rke2r1, v1.26.13+rke2r1). You should write this file before starting RKE2. Whereabouts is an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin that assigns IP addresses cluster-wide. RKE2 includes the option to use Whereabouts with Multus to manage the IP addresses of the additional interfaces created through Multus. In order to do this, you need to use HelmChartConfig to configure theMultus CNI to use Whereabouts. You can do this by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-multus-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-multus namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- rke2-whereabouts: enabled: true This will configure the chart for Multus to use rke2-whereabouts as a dependency. You should write this file before starting RKE2. SR-IOV experimental support was added in v1.21.2+rke2r1, and is fully supported starting with the April 2023 releases: v1.26.4+rke2r1, v1.25.9+rke2r1, and v1.24.13+rke2r1 Using the SR-IOV CNI with Multus can help with data-plane acceleration use cases, providing an extra interface in the pod that can achieve very high throughput. SR-IOV will not work in all environments, and there are several requirements that must be fulfilled to consider the node as SR-IOV capable: Physical NIC must support SR-IOV (e.g. by checking /sys/class/net/$NIC/device/sriov_totalvfs) The host operating system must activate IOMMU virtualization The host operating system includes drivers capable of doing sriov (e.g. i40e, vfio-pci, etc) The SR-IOV CNI plugin cannot be used as the default CNI plugin for Multus; it must be deployed alongside both Multus and a traditional CNI plugin. The SR-IOV CNI helm chart can be found in the rancher-charts Helm repo. For more information see Rancher Helm Charts documentation. After installing the SR-IOV CNI chart, the SR-IOV operator will be deployed. Then, the user must specify what nodes in the cluster are SR-IOV capable by labeling them with feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true: kubectl label node $NODE-NAME feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true Once labeled, the sriov-network-config Daemonset will deploy a pod to the node to collect information about the network interfaces. That information is available through the sriovnetworknodestates Custom Resource Definition. A couple of minutes after the deployment, there will be one sriovnetworknodestates resource per node, with the name of the node as the resource name. The SR-IOV CNI chart from rancher-charts now includes the node-feature-discovery chart as an automatic dependency. This chart deploys a small daemonset that automatically labels each node based on the capabilities detected on that node. This works for both hardware and software features. In particular, node-feature-discovery can automatically add the label feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true when it detects a compatible node. For more information, see the NFD documentation. However, the latest versions of the sriov-network-operator also include a whitelist of supported hardware so sriov will actually be available only with the NICs on that list. If you want to use the SR-IOV CNI with a NIC that is not on the list, you will need to update the supported-nic-ids configMap yourself. For more information about how to use the SR-IOV operator, please refer to sriov-network-operator.","title":"Multus and SR-IOV","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"multus_sriov","url":"/rke2/latest/en/networking/multus_sriov.html","titles":[{"text":"Using Multus","hash":"_using_multus","id":1},{"text":"Using Multus with Cilium","hash":"_using_multus_with_cilium","id":2},{"text":"Using Multus with the containernetworking plugins","hash":"_using_multus_with_the_containernetworking_plugins","id":3},{"text":"Multus IPAM plugin options","hash":"_multus_ipam_plugin_options","id":4},{"text":"Using Multus with SR-IOV","hash":"_using_multus_with_sr_iov","id":5}]},"27":{"id":27,"text":"This page explains how CoreDNS and the Nginx-Ingress controller work within RKE2. Refer to the Basic Network Options page for details on Canal configuration options, or how to set up your own CNI. For information on which ports need to be opened for RKE2, refer to the Installation Requirements. CoreDNS is deployed by default when starting the server. To disable, run each server with disable: rke2-coredns option in your configuration file. If you don’t install CoreDNS, you will need to install a cluster DNS provider yourself. CoreDNS is deployed with the autoscaler by default. To disable it or change its config, use the HelmChartConfig resource. NodeLocal DNSCache improves the performance by running a dns caching agent on each node. To activate this feature, apply the following HelmChartConfig: --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-coredns namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- nodelocal: enabled: true The helm controller will redeploy coredns with the new config. Please be aware that nodelocal modifies the iptables of the node to intercept DNS traffic. Therefore, activating and then deactivating this feature without redeploying, will cause the DNS service to stop working. Note that NodeLocal DNSCache must be deployed in ipvs mode if kube-proxy is using that mode.

If your choice of CNI is Cilium in kube-proxy replacement mode and you wish to use NodeLocal DNS Cache, you need to configure Cilium to use a Local Redirect Policy (LRP) to route the DNS traffic to your NodeLocal cache. This is because in this mode, Cilium eBPF routing bypasses iptables rules so nodelocal cannot configure them to route the DNS traffic towards itself. This is done in 2 steps: Activate the Local Redirect Policy feature in Cilium by setting the localRedirectPolicy flag to true in the Cilium HelmChartConfig. This would look like this: --- # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- kubeProxyReplacement: true k8sServiceHost: k8sServicePort: localRedirectPolicy: true Configure the rke2-coredns chart to setup its LRP by applying the following HelmChartConfig: --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-coredns namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- nodelocal: enabled: true use_cilium_lrp: true nginx-ingress is an Ingress controller powered by NGINX that uses a ConfigMap to store the NGINX configuration. nginx-ingress is deployed by default when starting the server. Ports 80 and 443 will be bound by the ingress controller in its default configuration, making these unusable for HostPort or NodePort services in the cluster. Configuration options can be specified by creating a HelmChartConfig manifest to customize the rke2-ingress-nginx HelmChart values. For example, a HelmChartConfig at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-ingress-nginx-config.yaml with the following contents sets use-forwarded-headers to \"true\" in the ConfigMap storing the NGINX config: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-ingress-nginx-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-ingress-nginx namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- controller: config: use-forwarded-headers: \"true\" For more information, refer to the official nginx-ingress Helm Configuration Parameters.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster: cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 (#3747) The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for containerd/7843 which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites. This v1.24.9+rke2r1 release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use v1.24.9+rke2r2 instead. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.24.9, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates.

You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at contrib/util/certs.sh. RKE2 now supports kubeadm style join tokens. rke2 token create now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL. RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster. ServiceLB now honors the Service’s ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster: cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 (#3746) The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for containerd/7843 which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites. This v1.25.5+rke2r1 release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use v1.25.5+rke2r2 instead. This release update Kubernetes to v1.25.5+rke2r1, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates. If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the --token CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup.

Please follow the upstream documentation to migrate from PSP if using the built-in PodSecurity Admission Plugin, prior to upgrading to v1.25.0+rke2r1. RKE2 now supports version 1.23 of the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes. The legacy CIS 1.5 and 1.6 profiles (profile: cis-1.5 and profile: cis-1.6) have been removed as they do not apply to Kubernetes 1.25. Servers using one of the legacy profiles must be updated to specify the cis-1.23 profile when upgrading to RKE2 1.25, or RKE2 will fail to start.

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean). If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the --token CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at contrib/util/certs.sh. RKE2 now supports kubeadm style join tokens. rke2 token create now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL. RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster. ServiceLB now honors the Service’s ExternalTrafficPolicy.

Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 (#3746) The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for containerd/7843 which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites. This v1.26.0+rke2r1 release is RKE2’s first in the v1.26 line. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.0. Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes Urgent Upgrade Notes. This release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use v1.26.0+rke2r2 instead.

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

Any certificates that are expired, or within 90 days of expiring, are automatically renewed every time RKE2 starts. To rotate client and server certificates manually, use the rke2 certificate rotate subcommand: # Stop RKE2 systemctl stop rke2-server # Rotate certificates rke2 certificate rotate # Start RKE2 systemctl start rke2-server Individual or lists of certificates can be rotated by specifying the certificate name: rke2 certificate rotate --service , The following certificates can be rotated: admin, api-server, controller-manager, scheduler, rke2-controller, rke2-server, cloud-controller, etcd, auth-proxy, kubelet, kube-proxy. Kubernetes requires a number of CA certificates for proper operation. For more information on how Kubernetes uses CA certificates, see the Kubernetes PKI Certificates and Requirements documentation. By default, RKE2 generates self-signed CA certificates during startup of the first server node. These CA certificates are valid for 10 years from date of issuance, and are not automatically renewed. The authoritative CA certificates and keys are stored within the datastore’s bootstrap key, encrypted using the server token as the PBKDF2 passphrase with AES256-GCM and HMAC-SHA1. Copies of the CA certificates and keys are extracted to disk during RKE2 server startup. Any server may generate leaf certificates for nodes as they join the cluster, and the Kubernetes Certificates API controllers may issue additional certificates at runtime. Version Gate Available as of the 2023-02 releases (v1.26.2+rke2r1, v1.25.7+rke2r1, v1.24.11+rke2r1, v1.23.17+rke2r1). To rotate CA certificates and keys, use the rke2 certificate rotate-ca command. This command performs integrity checks to confirm that the updated certificates and keys are usable. If the updated data is acceptable, the datastore’s encrypted bootstrap key is updated, and the new certificates and keys will be used the next time RKE2 starts. If problems are encountered while validating the certificates and keys, an error is reported to the system log and the operation is cancelled without changes. If CA certificates and keys are found the correct location during initial startup of the first server in the cluster, automatic generation of CA certificates will be bypassed. An example script to pre-create the appropriate certificates and keys is available in the K3s repo at contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh. This script should be run prior to starting RKE2 for the first time, and will create a full set of leaf CA certificates signed by common Root and Intermediate CA certificates. If you have an existing Root or Intermediate CA, this script can be used (or used as a starting point) to create the correct CA certificates to provision a RKE2 cluster with PKI rooted in an existing authority. Custom Certificate Authority files must be placed in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. The following files are required: server-ca.crt server-ca.key client-ca.crt client-ca.key request-header-ca.crt request-header-ca.key etcd/peer-ca.crt etcd/peer-ca.key etcd/server-ca.crt etcd/server-ca.key (This is the private key used to sign service-account tokens. It does not have a corresponding certificate.) service.key Custom CA Certificates should observe the following topology: graph TD root(\"Root CA\") intermediate(\"Intermediate CA\") server-ca(\"Server CA\") client-ca(\"Client CA\") request-header-ca(\"API Aggregation CA\") etcd-peer-ca(\"etcd Peer CA\") etcd-server-ca(\"etcd Server CA\") root-hash>\"Join token CA hash\"] kube-server-certs[[\"Kubernetes servers(control-plane and kubelet listeners)\"]] kube-client-certs[[\"Kubernetes clients(apiserver and kubelet clients)\"]] request-header-certs[[\"Kubernetes API aggregation(apiserver proxy client)\"]] etcd-peer-certs[[\"etcd peer client/server(etcd replication)\"]] etcd-server-certs[[\"etcd client/server certificates(Kubernetes etcd)\"]] root -.-|SHA256| root-hash root ---> intermediate intermediate --> server-ca ==> kube-server-certs intermediate --> client-ca ==> kube-client-certs intermediate --> request-header-ca ==> request-header-certs intermediate --> etcd-peer-ca ==> etcd-peer-certs intermediate --> etcd-server-ca ==> etcd-server-certs Important If you want to sign the cluster CA certificates with an existing root CA using the example script, you must place the root and intermediate files in the target directory prior to running the script. If the files do not exist, the script will create new root and intermediate CA certificates. If you want to use only an existing root CA certificate, provide the following files: root-ca.pem root-ca.key If you want to use existing root and intermediate CA certificates, provide the following files: root-ca.pem intermediate-ca.pem intermediate-ca.key To use the example script to generate custom certs and keys before starting RKE2, run the following commands: # Create the target directory for cert generation. mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls # Copy your root CA cert and intermediate CA cert+key into the correct location for the script. # For the purposes of this example, we assume you have existing root and intermediate CA files in /etc/ssl. # If you do not have an existing root and/or intermediate CA, the script will generate them for you. cp /etc/ssl/certs/root-ca.pem /etc/ssl/certs/intermediate-ca.pem /etc/ssl/private/intermediate-ca.key /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls # Generate custom CA certs and keys. curl -sL https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/raw/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh | PRODUCT=rke2 bash - If the command completes successfully, you may install and/or start RKE2 for the first time. If the script generated root and/or intermediate CA files, you should back up these files so that they can be reused if it is necessary to rotate the CA certificates at a later date. To rotate custom CA certificates, use the rke2 certificate rotate-ca subcommand. Updated files must be staged into a temporary directory, loaded into the datastore, and rke2 must be restarted on all nodes to use the updated certificates. You must not overwrite the currently in-use data in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. Stage the updated certificates and keys into a separate directory. A cluster that has been started with custom CA certificates can renew or rotate the CA certificates and keys non-disruptively, as long as the same root CA is used. If a new root CA is required, the rotation will be disruptive. The rke2 certificate rotate-ca --force option must be used, all nodes (servers and agents) will need to be reconfigured to use the new token value, and pods will need to be restarted to trust the new root CA. The example generate-custom-ca-certs.sh script linked above can also be used to generate updated certs in a new temporary directory, by copying files into the correct location and setting the DATA_DIR environment variable. To use the example script to generate updated certs and keys, run the following commands: # Create a temporary directory for cert generation. mkdir -p /opt/rke2/server/tls # Copy your root CA cert and intermediate CA cert+key into the correct location for the script. # Non-disruptive rotation requires the same root CA that was used to generate the original certificates. # If the original files are still in the data directory, you can just run: cp /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/root-ca.* /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/intermediate-ca.* /opt/rke2/server/tls # Copy the current service-account signing key, so that existing service-account tokens are not invalidated. cp /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/service.key /opt/rke2/server/tls # Generate updated custom CA certs and keys. curl -sL https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/raw/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh | DATA_DIR=/opt/rke2 PRODUCT=rke2 bash - # Load the updated CA certs and keys into the datastore. rke2 certificate rotate-ca --path=/opt/rke2/server If the rotate-ca command returns an error, check the service log for errors. If the command completes successfully, restart RKE2 on all nodes in the cluster - servers first, then agents. If you used the --force option or changed the root CA, ensure that any nodes that were joined with a secure token are reconfigured to use the new token value, prior to being restarted. The token may be stored in a .env file, systemd unit, or config.yaml, depending on how the node was configured during initial installation. To rotate the RKE2-generated self-signed CA certificates, use the rke2 certificate rotate-ca subcommand. Updated files must be staged into a temporary directory, loaded into the datastore, and rke2 must be restarted on all nodes to use the updated certificates. You must not overwrite the currently in-use data in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. Stage the updated certificates and keys into a separate directory. If the cluster has been started with default self-signed CA certificates, rotation will be disruptive. All nodes that were joined with a secure token will need to be reconfigured to trust the new CA hash. If the new CA certificates are not cross-signed by the old CA certificates, you will need to use the --force option to bypass integrity checks, and pods will need to be restarted to trust the new root CA. The default self-signed CA certificates have the following topology: graph TD server-ca(\"Server CA\") client-ca(\"Client CA\") request-header-ca(\"API Aggregation CA\") etcd-peer-ca(\"etcd Peer CA\") etcd-server-ca(\"etcd Server CA\") root-hash>\"Join token CA hash\"] kube-server-certs[[\"Kubernetes servers(control-plane and kubelet listeners)\"]] kube-client-certs[[\"Kubernetes clients(apiserver and kubelet clients)\"]] request-header-certs[[\"Kubernetes API aggregation(apiserver proxy client)\"]] etcd-peer-certs[[\"etcd peer client/server(etcd replication)\"]] etcd-server-certs[[\"etcd client/server certificates(Kubernetes etcd)\"]] server-ca -.-|SHA256| root-hash server-ca ===> kube-server-certs client-ca ===> kube-client-certs request-header-ca ===> request-header-certs etcd-peer-ca ===> etcd-peer-certs etcd-server-ca ===> etcd-server-certs When rotating the default self-signed CAs, a modified certificate topology with intermediate CAs and a new root CA cross-signed by the old CA can be used so that there is a continuous chain of trust between the old and new CAs: graph TD server-ca-old(\"Server CA(old)\") client-ca-old(\"Client CA(old)\") request-header-ca-old(\"API Aggregation CA(old)\") etcd-peer-ca-old(\"etcd Peer CA(old)\") etcd-server-ca-old(\"etcd Server CA(old)\") root-hash>\"Join token CA hash\"] server-ca-xsigned(\"Server CA(cross-signed)\") client-ca-xsigned(\"Client CA(cross-signed)\") request-header-ca-xsigned(\"API Aggregation CA(cross-signed)\") etcd-peer-ca-xsigned(\"etcd Peer CA(cross-signed)\") etcd-server-ca-xsigned(\"etcd Server CA(cross-signed)\") server-ca-ssigned(\"Server CA(self-signed)\") client-ca-ssigned(\"Client CA(self-signed)\") request-header-ca-ssigned(\"API Aggregation CA(self-signed)\") etcd-peer-ca-ssigned(\"etcd Peer CA(self-signed)\") etcd-server-ca-ssigned(\"etcd Server CA(self-signed)\") server-ca(\"IntermediateServer CA\") client-ca(\"IntermediateClient CA\") request-header-ca(\"IntermediateAPI Aggregation CA\") etcd-peer-ca(\"Intermediateetcd Peer CA\") etcd-server-ca(\"Intermediateetcd Server CA\") kube-server-certs[[\"Kubernetes servers(control-plane and kubelet listeners)\"]] kube-client-certs[[\"Kubernetes clients(apiserver and kubelet clients)\"]] request-header-certs[[\"Kubernetes API aggregation(apiserver proxy client)\"]] etcd-peer-certs[[\"etcd peer client/server(etcd replication)\"]] etcd-server-certs[[\"etcd client/server certificates(Kubernetes etcd)\"]] server-ca-ssigned -.-|SHA256| root-hash server-ca-ssigned --> server-ca ==> kube-server-certs server-ca-old --> server-ca-xsigned --> server-ca client-ca-ssigned --> client-ca ==> kube-client-certs client-ca-old --> client-ca-xsigned --> client-ca request-header-ca-ssigned --> request-header-ca ==> request-header-certs request-header-ca-old --> request-header-ca-xsigned --> request-header-ca etcd-peer-ca-ssigned --> etcd-peer-ca ==> etcd-peer-certs etcd-peer-ca-old --> etcd-peer-ca-xsigned --> etcd-peer-ca etcd-server-ca-ssigned --> etcd-server-ca ==> etcd-server-certs etcd-server-ca-old --> etcd-server-ca-xsigned --> etcd-server-ca An example script to create updated CA certificates and keys cross-signed by the existing CAs is available in the K3s repo at contrib/util/rotate-default-ca-certs.sh. To use the example script to generate updated self-signed certificates that are cross-signed by the existing CAs, run the following commands: # Create updated CA certs and keys, cross-signed by the current CAs. # This script will create a new temporary directory containing the updated certs, and output the new token values. curl -sL https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/raw/master/contrib/util/rotate-default-ca-certs.sh | PRODUCT=rke2 bash - # Load the updated certs into the datastore; see the script output for the updated token values. rke2 certificate rotate-ca --path=/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/rotate-ca If the rotate-ca command returns an error, check the service log for errors. If the command completes successfully, restart RKE2 on all nodes in the cluster - servers first, then agents. Ensure that any nodes that were joined with a secure token, including other server nodes, are reconfigured to use the new token value prior to being restarted. The token may be stored in a .env file, systemd unit, or config.yaml, depending on how the node was configured during initial installation. The service-account issuer key is an RSA private key used to sign service-account tokens. When rotating the service-account issuer key, at least one old key should be retained in the file so that existing service-account tokens are not invalidated. It can be rotated independent of the cluster CAs by using the rke2 certificate rotate-ca to install only an updated service.key file that includes both the new and old keys. You must not overwrite the currently in-use data in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. Stage the updated key into a separate directory. For example, to rotate only the service-account issuer key, run the following commands: # Create a temporary directory for cert generation mkdir -p /opt/rke2/server/tls # Check OpenSSL version openssl version | grep -qF 'OpenSSL 3' && OPENSSL_GENRSA_FLAGS=-traditional # Generate a new key openssl genrsa ${OPENSSL_GENRSA_FLAGS:-} -out /opt/rke2/server/tls/service.key 2048 # Append the existing key to avoid invalidating current tokens cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/service.key >> /opt/rke2/server/tls/service.key # Load the updated key into the datastore rke2 certificate rotate-ca --path=/opt/rke2/server It is normal to see warnings for files that are not being updated. If the rotate-ca command returns an error, check the service log for errors. If the command completes successfully, restart RKE2 on all servers in the cluster. It is not necessary to restart agents or restart any pods.","title":"Certificate Management","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"certificates","url":"/rke2/latest/en/security/certificates.html","titles":[{"text":"Client and Server Certificates","hash":"_client_and_server_certificates","id":1},{"text":"Rotating Client and Server Certificates Manually","hash":"_rotating_client_and_server_certificates_manually","id":2},{"text":"Certificate Authority (CA) Certificates","hash":"_certificate_authority_ca_certificates","id":3},{"text":"Rotating CA Certificates","hash":"_rotating_ca_certificates","id":4},{"text":"Using Custom CA Certificates","hash":"_using_custom_ca_certificates","id":5},{"text":"Custom CA Topology","hash":"_custom_ca_topology","id":6},{"text":"Using the Example Script","hash":"_using_the_example_script","id":7},{"text":"Rotating Custom CA Certificates","hash":"_rotating_custom_ca_certificates","id":8},{"text":"Using the Example Script","hash":"_using_the_example_script_2","id":9},{"text":"Rotating Self-Signed CA Certificates","hash":"_rotating_self_signed_ca_certificates","id":10},{"text":"Default CA Topology","hash":"_default_ca_topology","id":11},{"text":"Using The Example Script","hash":"_using_the_example_script_3","id":12},{"text":"Service-Account Issuer Key Rotation","hash":"_service_account_issuer_key_rotation","id":13}]},"44":{"id":44,"text":"This document is a companion to the RKE2 security hardening guide. The hardening guide provides prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2, and this benchmark guide is meant to help you evaluate the level of security of the hardened cluster against each control in the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. It is to be used by RKE2 operators, security teams, auditors, and decision makers. This guide is specific to the v1.25 release line of RKE2 and the v1.23 release of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. For more details about each control, including detailed descriptions and remediations for failing tests, you can refer to the corresponding section of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.23 You can download the benchmark after logging in to CISecurity.org. Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated against an RKE2 cluster that was configured according to the accompanying hardening guide. Where control audits differ from the original CIS benchmark, the audit commands specific to RKE2 are provided for testing. These are the possible results for each control: Pass - The RKE2 cluster under test passed the audit outlined in the benchmark. Not Applicable - The control is not applicable to RKE2 because of how it is designed to operate. The remediation section will explain why this is so. Manual - Operator Dependent - The control is Manual in the CIS benchmark and it depends on the cluster’s use case or some other factor that must be determined by the cluster operator. These controls have been evaluated to ensure RKE2 does not prevent their implementation, but no further configuration or auditing of the cluster under test has been performed.

No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the Container Network Interface file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal.yaml 644 Remediation: RKE2 deploys the default CNI, Canal, using a Helm chart. The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the Container Network Interface file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal.yaml root:root Remediation: RKE2 deploys the default CNI, Canal, using a Helm chart. The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd 700 Remediation: RKE2 manages the etcd data directory and sets its permissions to 700. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd etcd:etcd Remediation: When running RKE2 with the profile flag set to cis-1.23, RKE2 will refuse to start if the etcd user and group doesn’t exist on the host. If it does exist, RKE2 will automatically set the ownership of the etcd data directory to etcd:etcd and ensure the etcd static pod is started with that user and group. Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The admin.conf is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various settings for the administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig and automatically sets its permissions to 644. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admin.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The admin.conf file contains the admin credentials for the cluster. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig and automatically sets its ownership to root:root. Ensure that the scheduler.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The scheduler.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig and automatically sets its permissions to 644. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the scheduler.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The scheduler.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig and automatically sets its ownership to root:root. Ensure that the controller.kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The controller.kubeconfig file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig and automatically sets its permissions to 644. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the controller.kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The controller.kubeconfig file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig and automatically sets its ownership to root:root. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the directory and files with the expected ownership of root:root. No manual remediation should be necessary. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI certificate file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 644 or more restrictive to protect their integrity. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.crt Verify that the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 644. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600 (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 600 to protect their integrity and confidentiality. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.key Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 600. No manual remediation is needed. This section contains recommendations relating to API server configuration flags Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Manual). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. If you are using RBAC authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this recommendation is Manual. However, you should consider whether anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that --anonymous-auth=false is present. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is configured to run with this flag and value. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --token-auth-file parameter is not set (Automated). Rationale The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --token-auth-file argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not run with token authentication enabled. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --DenyServiceExternalIPs is not set (Automated). Rationale This admission controller rejects all net-new usage of the Service field externalIPs. This feature is very powerful (allows network traffic interception) and not well controlled by policy. When enabled, users of the cluster may not create new Services which use externalIPs and may not add new values to externalIPs on existing Service objects. Existing uses of externalIPs are not affected, and users may remove values from externalIPs on existing Service objects. Most users do not need this feature at all, and cluster admins should consider disabling it. Clusters that do need to use this feature should consider using some custom policy to manage usage of it. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument does not have DenyServiceExternalIPs. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set DenyServiceExternalIPs to the admission plugin flag. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Connections from apiserver to kubelets could potentially carry sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is thus important to use in-transit encryption for any communication between the apiserver and kubelets. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-https argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver doesn’t run with the --kubelet-https parameter as it runs with TLS. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate- based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with these arguments for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with this argument for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the argument value doesn’t contain AlwaysAllow. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes Node (Automated). Rationale The Node authorization mode only allows kubelets to read Secret, ConfigMap, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim objects associated with their nodes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify Node exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated). Rationale Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify RBAC exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin EventRateLimit is set (Manual). Rationale Using EventRateLimit admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept. This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes EventRateLimit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit allows all requests and do not filter any requests. The AlwaysAdmit admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set, its value does not include AlwaysAdmit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysPullImages is set (Manual). Rationale Setting admission control policy to AlwaysPullImages forces every new pod to pull the required images every time. In a multi-tenant cluster users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by knowing the image’s name, without any authorization check against the image ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are required. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes AlwaysPullImages. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy is not used (Manual). Rationale SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes SecurityContextDeny, if PodSecurityPolicy is not included. Remediation: By default, RKE2 automatically enables the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin. Therefore, the SecurityContextDeny plugin need not be enabled. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set (Automated). Rationale When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not includes ServiceAccount. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. If there’s a desire to use this argument, follow the documentation and create ServiceAccount objects as per your environment. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin NamespaceLifecycle is set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control policy to NamespaceLifecycle ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not include NamespaceLifecycle. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set (Automated). Rationale Using the NodeRestriction plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the Node and Pod objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own Node API object, and only modify Pod API objects that are bound to their node. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes NodeRestriction. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The secure port is used to serve https with authentication and authorization. If you disable it, no https traffic is served and all traffic is served unencrypted. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --secure-port argument is either not set or is set to an integer value between 1 and 65535. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the parameter of 6443 for the --secure-port argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-path argument is set (Automated). Rationale Auditing the Kubernetes API Server provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators or other components of the system. Even though currently, Kubernetes provides only basic audit capabilities, it should be enabled. You can enable it by setting an appropriate audit log path. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-path argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-path argument and parameter. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that you can go back in time and investigate or correlate any events. Set your audit log retention period to 30 days or as per your business requirements. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxage argument parameter to 30. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. For example, if you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxbackup argument parameter to 10. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxsize argument parameter to 100. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --request-timeout argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Setting global request timeout allows extending the API server request timeout limit to a duration appropriate to the user’s connection speed. By default, it is set to 60 seconds which might be problematic on slower connections making cluster resources inaccessible once the data volume for requests exceeds what can be transmitted in 60 seconds. But, setting this timeout limit to be too large can exhaust the API server resources making it prone to Denial-of-Service attack. Hence, it is recommended to set this limit as appropriate and change the default limit of 60 seconds only if needed. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --request-timeout argument is either not set or set to an appropriate value. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --request-timeout argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-lookup argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale If --service-account-lookup is not enabled, the apiserver only verifies that the authentication token is valid, and does not validate that the service account token mentioned in the request is actually present in etcd. This allows using a service account token even after the corresponding service account is deleted. This is an example of time of check to time of use security issue. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --service-account-lookup argument exists it is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 doesn’t set this argument in favor of taking the default effect. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale By default, if no --service-account-key-file is specified to the apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be specified to the apiserver with --service-account-key-file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-key-file argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-key-file explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate and key. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If --client-ca-file argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the client-ca-file is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --client-ca-file argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-cafile argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a SSL Certificate Authority file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-cafile argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-cafile argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set to a EncryptionConfigfile. Additionally, ensure that the EncryptionConfigfile has all the desired resources covered especially any secrets. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --encryption-provider-config argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. RKE2’s default encryption provider config file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json and is configured to encrypt secrets. Ensure that encryption providers are appropriately configured (Automated). Rationale Where etcd encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the aescbc, kms and secretbox are likely to be appropriate options. Result: Pass Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a EncryptionConfig file. In this file, choose aescbc, kms or secretbox as the encryption provider. Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep aescbc /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json Run the below command on the master node. Verify that aescbc is set as the encryption provider for all the desired resources. Remediation By default, RKE2 sets the argument --encryption-provider-config and parameter. The contents of the config file indicates the use of aescbc. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the API Server only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cipher-suites argument is set as outlined in the remediation procedure below. Remediation: By default, RKE2 explicitly doesn’t set this flag. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate (Manual). Rationale Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case, the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The current setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which might be too high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage collection. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument with a value of 1000. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale The controller manager creates a service account per controller in the kube-system namespace, generates a credential for it, and builds a dedicated API client with that service account credential for each controller loop to use. Setting the --use-service-account-credentials to true runs each control loop within the controller manager using a separate service account credential. When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --use-service-account-credentials argument to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with --service-account-private-key-file as appropriate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-private-key-file argument with the service account key file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API server’s serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Providing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate to the controller manager with the --root-ca-file argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --root-ca-file argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --root-ca-file argument with the root ca file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that RotateKubeletServerCertificateargument exists and is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section contains recommendations relating to Scheduler configuration flags Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section covers recommendations for etcd configuration. Ensure that the cert-file and key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'cert-file|key-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the cert-file and the key-file fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Server and peer cert and key files are specified. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the client-cert-auth field is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the client-cert-auth field is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. client-cert-auth is set to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the auto-tls argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-cert-file and peer-key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit and also amongst peers in the etcd clusters. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'peer-server-client.crt|peer-server-client.key' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'peer-client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the peer-client-cert-auth field in the peer section is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the client-cert-auth field is set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Hence, do not use self- signed certificates for authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'peer-auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the peer-auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the peer-auto-tls field. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that a unique Certificate Authority is used for etcd (Manual). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. Its access should be restricted to specifically designated clients and peers only. Authentication to etcd is based on whether the certificate presented was issued by a trusted certificate authority. There is no checking of certificate attributes such as common name or subject alternative name. As such, if any attackers were able to gain access to any certificate issued by the trusted certificate authority, they would be able to gain full access to the etcd database. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # To find the ca file used by etcd: grep 'trusted-ca-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config # To find the kube-apiserver process: /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the file referenced by the client-ca-file flag in the apiserver process is different from the file referenced by the trusted-ca-file parameter in the etcd configuration file. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config and the trusted-ca-file parameters in it are set to unique values specific to etcd. No manual remediation needed. Client certificate authentication should not be used for users (Manual). Rationale With any authentication mechanism the ability to revoke credentials if they are compromised or no longer required, is a key control. Kubernetes client certificate authentication does not allow for this due to a lack of support for certificate revocation. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of Kubernetes client certificate authentication. Remediation: Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented in place of client certificates. Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created (Automated). Rationale Logging is an important detective control for all systems, to detect potential unauthorised access. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-policy-file is set. Review the contents of the file specified and ensure that it contains a valid audit policy. Remediation: Create an audit policy file for your cluster. Ensure that the audit policy covers key security concerns (Manual). Rationale Security audit logs should cover access and modification of key resources in the cluster, to enable them to form an effective part of a security environment. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The kube-proxy kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. It is possible to run kube-proxy with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml 644 Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubeconfig file for kube-proxy controls various parameters for the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml root:root Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the certificate authorities file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt 644 Verify that the permissions are 644. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt with 644 permissions. Ensure that the client certificate authorities file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt with root:root ownership. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file has permissions set to 600 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. This section contains recommendations for kubelet configuration. Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the value for --anonymous-auth is false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts kubelet with --anonymous-auth set to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that AlwaysAllow is not present. Remediation: RKE2 starts kubelet with Webhook as the value for the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument has a ca file associated. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --client-ca-file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --read-only-port argument set to 0. Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports. By default, --streaming-connection-idle-timeout is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that there’s nothing returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set --streaming-connection-idle-timeout when starting kubelet. Ensure that the --protect-kernel-defaults argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kernel parameters are usually tuned and hardened by the system administrators before putting the systems into production. These parameters protect the kernel and the system. Your kubelet kernel defaults that rely on such parameters should be appropriately set to match the desired secured system state. Ignoring this could potentially lead to running pods with undesired kernel behavior. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: When running with the profile flag set to cis-1.23, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --protect-kernel-defaults argument set to true. Ensure that the --make-iptables-util-chains argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kubelets can automatically manage the required changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the pods. It is recommended to let kubelets manage the changes to iptables. This ensures that the iptables configuration remains in sync with pods networking configuration. Manually configuring iptables with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world. You might have iptables rules too restrictive or too open. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify there are no results returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --make-iptables-util-chains argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set (Manual). Rationale Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 does set this parameter for each host, but RKE2 also manages all certificates in the cluster. It ensures the hostname-override is included as a subject alternative name (SAN) in the kubelet’s certificate. Ensure that the --event-qps argument is set to 0 or a level which ensures appropriate event capture (Manual). Rationale It is important to capture all events and not restrict event creation. Events are an important source of security information and analytics that ensure that your environment is consistently monitored using the event data. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: See CIS Benchmark guide for further details on configuring this. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubelet communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the Kubelets to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are present and set appropriately. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments when executing the kubelet process. Ensure that the --rotate-certificates argument is not set to false (Manual). Rationale The --rotate-certificates setting causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there is no downtime due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. This feature also require the RotateKubeletClientCertificate feature gate to be enabled (which is the default since Kubernetes v1.7). Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Manual). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the Kubelet only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Configuration of the parameter is dependent on your use case. Please see the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark for suggestions on configuring this for your use case. Ensure that the cluster-admin role is only used where required (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as cluster-admin provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as cluster-admin allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a ClusterRoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a RoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding’s namespace, including the namespace itself. Result: Pass Remediation: RKE2 does not make inappropriate use of the cluster-admin role. Operators must audit their workloads of additional usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to secrets (Manual). Rationale Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials are stored as secrets. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: RKE2 limits its use of secrets for the system components appropriately, but operators must audit the use of secrets by their workloads. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles (Manual). Rationale The principle of least privilege recommends that users are provided only the access required for their role and nothing more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide excessive rights to the Kubernetes API. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # Retrieve the roles defined across each namespaces in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml # Retrieve the cluster roles defined in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get clusterroles -o yaml Verify that there are not wildcards in use. Remediation: Operators should review their workloads for proper role usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to create pods (Manual). Rationale The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Operators should review who has access to create pods in their cluster. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used. (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. Result: Pass. Audit: For each namespace in the cluster, review the rights assigned to the default service account and ensure that it has no roles or cluster roles bound to it apart from the defaults. Additionally ensure that the automountServiceAccountToken: false setting is in place for each default service account. Remediation: Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access to the Kubernetes API server. Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value automountServiceAccountToken: false Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary (Manual). Rationale Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster. Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: The pods launched by RKE2 are part of the control plane and generally need access to communicate with the API server, thus this control does not apply to them. Operators should review their workloads and take steps to modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it. Avoid use of system:masters group (Manual). Rationale The system:masters group has unrestricted access to the Kubernetes API hard-coded into the API server source code. An authenticated user who is a member of this group cannot have their access reduced, even if all bindings and cluster role bindings which mention it, are removed. When combined with client certificate authentication, use of this group can allow for irrevocable cluster-admin level credentials to exist for a cluster. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Remove the system:masters group from all users in the cluster. Limit use of the Bind, Impersonate and Escalate permissions in the Kubernetes cluster (Manual). Rationale The impersonate privilege allows a subject to impersonate other users gaining their rights to the cluster. The bind privilege allows the subject to add a binding to a cluster role or role which escalates their effective permissions in the cluster. The escalate privilege allows a subject to modify cluster roles to which they are bound, increasing their rights to that level. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Where possible, remove the impersonate, bind and escalate rights from subjects. Ensure that the cluster has at least one active policy control mechanism in place (Manual). Rationale Without an active policy control mechanism, it is not possible to limit the use of containers with access to underlying cluster nodes, via mechanisms like privileged containers, or the use of hostPath volume mounts. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: PSA is enabled since v1.23 by default in RKE2, no remediation necessary. Minimize the admission of privileged containers (Manual). Rationale A container running in the host’s PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node to ensure restricted level is enabled in the config file. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host IPC namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s IPC namespace can use IPC to interact with processes outside the container. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host IPC namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostIPC, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s network namespace could access the local loopback device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host network namespace. If you need to run containers which require access to the host’s network namespaces, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of hostNetwork containers. Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated). Rationale A container running with the allowPrivilegeEscalation flag set to true may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run. If you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers with .spec.allowPrivilegeEscalationset to true. Minimize the admission of root containers (Automated). Rationale Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout. Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit root containers. If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Create a policy for each namespace in the cluster, ensuring that either MustRunAsNonRoot or MustRunAs with the range of UIDs not including 0, is set. Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability (Automated). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers. Ideally, all containers should drop this capability. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers with the NET_RAW capability. If you need to run containers with this capability, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted. Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability. Minimize the admission of containers with added capabilities (Automated). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities outside this set can be added to containers which could expose them to risks of container breakout attacks. There should be at least one policy defined which prevents containers with capabilities beyond the default set from launching. If you need to run containers with additional capabilities, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Manual Remediation: Ensure that allowedCapabilities is not present in policies for the cluster unless it is set to an empty array. Minimize the admission of containers with capabilities assigned (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized. Result: Manual Remediation: Review the use of capabilities in applications running on your cluster. Where a namespace contains applications which do not require any Linux capabilities to operate consider adding a PSP which forbids the admission of containers which do not drop all capabilities. Minimize the admission of Windows HostProcess containers (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized. Result: Manual Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers that have .securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess set to true. Minimize the admission of HostPath volumes (Manual). Rationale A container which mounts a hostPath volume as part of its specification will have access to the filesystem of the underlying cluster node. The use of hostPath volumes may allow containers access to privileged areas of the node filesystem. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to mount hostPath volumes. If you need to run containers which require hostPath volumes, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Manual Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers with hostPath volumes. Minimize the admission of containers which use HostPorts (Manual). Rationale Host ports connect containers directly to the host’s network. This can bypass controls such as network policy. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers which require the use of HostPorts. If you need to run containers which require HostPorts, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Manual Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers which use hostPort sections. Ensure that the CNI in use supports Network Policies (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and Egress network policies. Result: Pass Audit: Review the documentation of CNI plugin in use by the cluster, and confirm that it supports Ingress and Egress network policies. Remediation: By default, RKE2 use Canal (Calico and Flannel) and fully supports network policies. Ensure that all Namespaces have Network Policies defined (Automated). Rationale Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. for i in kube-system kube-public default; do /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get networkpolicies -n $i; done Verify that there are network policies applied to each of the namespaces. Remediation: RKE2, when executed with the --profile=cis-1.23 argument applies a secure network policy that only allows intra-namespace traffic and DNS to kube-system. No manual remediation needed. Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables (Manual). Rationale It is reasonably common for application code to log out its environment (particularly in the event of an error). This will include any secret values passed in as environment variables, so secrets can easily be exposed to any user or entity who has access to the logs. Result: Manual Audit: Run the following command to find references to objects which use environment variables defined from secrets. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@..secretKeyRef)]} {.kind} {.metadata.name} {\"\\n\"}{end}' -A Remediation: If possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than from environment variables. Consider external secret storage (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Result: Manual Audit: Review your secrets management implementation. Remediation: Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party secrets management solution. Configure Image Provenance using ImagePolicyWebhook admission controller (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports plugging in provenance rules to accept or reject the images in your deployments. You could configure such rules to ensure that only approved images are deployed in the cluster. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that image provenance is configured as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance. The v1.23 guide skips 5.6 and goes from 5.5 to 5.7. We are including it here merely for explanation. These policies relate to general cluster management topics, like namespace best practices and policies applied to pod objects in the cluster. Create administrative boundaries between resources using namespaces (Manual). Rationale Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called default. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command and review the namespaces created in the cluster. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get namespaces Ensure that these namespaces are the ones you need and are adequately administered as per your requirements. Remediation: Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need them. Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in your pod definitions (Manual). Rationale Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster. It should create a line as below: annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default Remediation: Review the Kubernetes documentation and if needed, apply a relevant PodSecurityPolicy. Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers (Manual). Rationale A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark. The default namespace should not be used (Manual). Rationale Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -n default Verify that there are no resources applied to the default namespace. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not utilize the default namespace.","title":"CIS 1.23 Self-Assessment

document is a companion to the RKE2 security hardening guide. The hardening guide provides prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2, and this benchmark guide is meant to help you evaluate the level of security of the hardened cluster against each control in the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. It is to be used by RKE2 operators, security teams, auditors, and decision makers. This guide is specific to the v1.20 release line of RKE2 and the v1.6.1 release of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. For more detail about each control, including more detailed descriptions and remediations for failing tests, you can refer to the corresponding section of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6. You can download the benchmark after logging in to CISecurity.org. Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated against an RKE2 cluster that was configured according to the accompanying hardening guide. Where control audits differ from the original CIS benchmark, the audit commands specific to RKE2 are provided for testing. These are the possible results for each control: Pass - The RKE2 cluster under test passed the audit outlined in the benchmark. Not Applicable - The control is not applicable to RKE2 because of how it is designed to operate. The remediation section will explain why this is so. Manual - Operator Dependent - The control is Manual in the CIS benchmark and it depends on the cluster’s use case or some other factor that must be determined by the cluster operator. These controls have been evaluated to ensure RKE2 does not prevent their implementation, but no further configuration or auditing of the cluster under test has been performed. Ensure that the API server pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated).

Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal.yml root:root Remediation: RKE2 deploys the default CNI, Canal, using a Helm chart. The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd 700 Remediation: RKE2 manages the etcd data directory and sets its permissions to 700. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd etcd:etcd Remediation: When running RKE2 with the profile flag set to cis-1.6, RKE2 will refuse to start if the etcd user and group doesn’t exist on the host. If it does exist, RKE2 will automatically set the ownership of the etcd data directory to etcd:etcd and ensure the etcd static pod is started with that user and group. Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The admin.conf is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various settings for the administration of the cluster.

Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the directory and files with the expected ownership of root:root. No manual remediation should be necessary. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI certificate file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 644 or more restrictive to protect their integrity. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.crt Verify that the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 644. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600 (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 600 to protect their integrity and confidentiality. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.key Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 600. No manual remediation is needed. This section contains recommendations relating to API server configuration flags Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Manual). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. If you are using RBAC authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this recommendation is Manual. However, you should consider whether anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that --anonymous-auth=false is present. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is configured to run with this flag and value. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --basic-auth-file argument is not set (Automated). Rationale Basic authentication uses plaintext credentials for authentication. Currently, the basic authentication credentials last indefinitely, and the password cannot be changed without restarting the API server. The basic authentication is currently supported for convenience. Hence, basic authentication should not be used. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --basic-auth-file argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not run with basic authentication enabled. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --token-auth-file parameter is not set (Automated). Rationale The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --token-auth-file argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not run with basic authentication enabled. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Connections from apiserver to kubelets could potentially carry sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is thus important to use in-transit encryption for any communication between the apiserver and kubelets. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-https argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver doesn’t run with the --kubelet-https parameter as it runs with TLS. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate- based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with these arguments for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with this argument for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the argument value doesn’t contain AlwaysAllow. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes Node (Automated). Rationale The Node authorization mode only allows kubelets to read Secret, ConfigMap, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim objects associated with their nodes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify Node exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated). Rationale Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify RBAC exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin EventRateLimit is set (Manual). Rationale Using EventRateLimit admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept. This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes EventRateLimit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit allows all requests and do not filter any requests. The AlwaysAdmit admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set, its value does not include AlwaysAdmit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysPullImages is set (Manual). Rationale Setting admission control policy to AlwaysPullImages forces every new pod to pull the required images every time. In a multi-tenant cluster users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by knowing the image’s name, without any authorization check against the image ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are required. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes AlwaysPullImages. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy is not used (Manual). Rationale SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes SecurityContextDeny, if PodSecurityPolicy is not included. Remediation: By default, RKE2 automatically enables the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin. Therefore, the SecurityContextDeny plugin need not be enabled. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set (Automated). Rationale When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not includes ServiceAccount. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. If there’s a desire to use this argument, follow the documentation and create ServiceAccount objects as per your environment. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin NamespaceLifecycle is set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control policy to NamespaceLifecycle ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not include NamespaceLifecycle. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin PodSecurityPolicy is set (Automated). Rationale A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls the actions that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to access. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies are comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features a pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access permissions. When the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin is in use, there needs to be at least one PodSecurityPolicy in place for ANY pods to be admitted. See section 1.7 for recommendations on PodSecurityPolicy settings. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes PodSecurityPolicy. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set (Automated). Rationale Using the NodeRestriction plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the Node and Pod objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own Node API object, and only modify Pod API objects that are bound to their node. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --insecure-bind-address argument is not set (Automated). Rationale If you bind the apiserver to an insecure address, basically anyone who could connect to it over the insecure port, would have unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your master node. The apiserver doesn’t do any authentication checking for insecure binds and traffic to the Insecure API port is not encrypted, allowing attackers to potentially read sensitive data in transit. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --insecure-bind-address argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 explicitly excludes the use of the --insecure-bind-address parameter. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0 (Automated). Rationale Setting up the apiserver to serve on an insecure port would allow unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your master node. This would allow attackers who could access this port, to easily take control of the cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kube-apiserver process with this argument’s parameter set to 0. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The secure port is used to serve https with authentication and authorization. If you disable it, no https traffic is served and all traffic is served unencrypted. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --secure-port argument is either not set or is set to an integer value between 1 and 65535. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the parameter of 6443 for the --secure-port argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-path argument is set (Automated). Rationale Auditing the Kubernetes API Server provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators or other components of the system. Even though currently, Kubernetes provides only basic audit capabilities, it should be enabled. You can enable it by setting an appropriate audit log path. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-path argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-path argument and parameter. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that you can go back in time and investigate or correlate any events. Set your audit log retention period to 30 days or as per your business requirements. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxage argument parameter to 30. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. For example, if you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxbackup argument parameter to 10. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxsize argument parameter to 100. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --request-timeout argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Setting global request timeout allows extending the API server request timeout limit to a duration appropriate to the user’s connection speed. By default, it is set to 60 seconds which might be problematic on slower connections making cluster resources inaccessible once the data volume for requests exceeds what can be transmitted in 60 seconds. But, setting this timeout limit to be too large can exhaust the API server resources making it prone to Denial-of-Service attack. Hence, it is recommended to set this limit as appropriate and change the default limit of 60 seconds only if needed. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --request-timeout argument is either not set or set to an appropriate value. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --request-timeout argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-lookup argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale If --service-account-lookup is not enabled, the apiserver only verifies that the authentication token is valid, and does not validate that the service account token mentioned in the request is actually present in etcd. This allows using a service account token even after the corresponding service account is deleted. This is an example of time of check to time of use security issue. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --service-account-lookup argument exists it is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 doesn’t set this argument in favor of taking the default effect. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale By default, if no --service-account-key-file is specified to the apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be specified to the apiserver with --service-account-key-file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-key-file argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-key-file explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate and key. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If --client-ca-file argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the client-ca-file is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --client-ca-file argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-cafile argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a SSL Certificate Authority file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-cafile argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-cafile argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set to a EncryptionConfigfile. Additionally, ensure that the EncryptionConfigfile has all the desired resources covered especially any secrets. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --encryption-provider-config argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. RKE2’s default encryption provider config file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json and is configured to encrypt secrets. Ensure that encryption providers are appropriately configured (Automated). Rationale Where etcd encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the aescbc, kms and secretbox are likely to be appropriate options. Result: Pass Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a EncryptionConfig file. In this file, choose aescbc, kms or secretbox as the encryption provider. Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep aescbc /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json Run the below command on the master node. Verify that aescbc is set as the encryption provider for all the desired resources. Remediation By default, RKE2 sets the argument --encryption-provider-config and parameter. The contents of the config file indicates the use of aescbc. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the API Server only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cipher-suites argument is set as outlined in the remediation procedure below. Remediation: By default, RKE2 explicitly doesn’t set this flag. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate (Manual). Rationale Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case, the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The current setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which might be too high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage collection. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument with a value of 1000. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale The controller manager creates a service account per controller in the kube-system namespace, generates a credential for it, and builds a dedicated API client with that service account credential for each controller loop to use. Setting the --use-service-account-credentials to true runs each control loop within the controller manager using a separate service account credential. When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --use-service-account-credentials argument to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with --service-account-private-key-file as appropriate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-private-key-file argument with the service account key file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API server’s serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Providing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate to the controller manager with the --root-ca-file argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --root-ca-file argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --root-ca-file argument with the root ca file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that RotateKubeletServerCertificateargument exists and is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section contains recommendations relating to Scheduler configuration flags Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section covers recommendations for etcd configuration. Ensure that the cert-file and key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'cert-file|key-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the cert-file and the key-file fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Server and peer cert and key files are specified. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the client-cert-auth field is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the client-cert-auth field is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. client-cert-auth is set to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the auto-tls argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-cert-file and peer-key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit and also amongst peers in the etcd clusters. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'peer-server-client.crt|peer-server-client.key' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the client-cert-auth field is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the client-cert-auth field in the peer section is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the client-cert-auth field is set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Hence, do not use self- signed certificates for authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'peer-auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the peer-auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the peer-auto-tls field. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that a unique Certificate Authority is used for etcd (Manual). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. Its access should be restricted to specifically designated clients and peers only. Authentication to etcd is based on whether the certificate presented was issued by a trusted certificate authority. There is no checking of certificate attributes such as common name or subject alternative name. As such, if any attackers were able to gain access to any certificate issued by the trusted certificate authority, they would be able to gain full access to the etcd database. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # To find the ca file used by etcd: grep 'trusted-ca-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config # To find the kube-apiserver process: /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the file referenced by the client-ca-file flag in the apiserver process is different from the file referenced by the trusted-ca-file parameter in the etcd configuration file. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config and the trusted-ca-file parameters in it are set to unique values specific to etcd. No manual remediation needed. Client certificate authentication should not be used for users (Manual). Rationale With any authentication mechanism the ability to revoke credentials if they are compromised or no longer required, is a key control. Kubernetes client certificate authentication does not allow for this due to a lack of support for certificate revocation. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of Kubernetes client certificate authentication. Remediation: Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented in place of client certificates. Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created (Automated). Rationale Logging is an important detective control for all systems, to detect potential unauthorised access. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-policy-file is set. Review the contents of the file specified and ensure that it contains a valid audit policy. Remediation: Create an audit policy file for your cluster. Ensure that the audit policy covers key security concerns (Manual). Rationale Security audit logs should cover access and modification of key resources in the cluster, to enable them to form an effective part of a security environment. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The kube-proxy kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. It is possible to run kube-proxy with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml 644 Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubeconfig file for kube-proxy controls various parameters for the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml root:root Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the certificate authorities file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt 644 Verify that the permissions are 644. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt with 644 permissions. Ensure that the client certificate authorities file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt with root:root ownership. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file has permissions set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. This section contains recommendations for kubelet configuration. Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the value for --anonymous-auth is false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts kubelet with --anonymous-auth set to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that AlwaysAllow is not present. Remediation: RKE2 starts kubelet with Webhook as the value for the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument has a ca file associated. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --client-ca-file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --read-only-port argument set to 0. Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports. By default, --streaming-connection-idle-timeout is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that there’s nothing returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set --streaming-connection-idle-timeout when starting kubelet. Ensure that the --protect-kernel-defaults argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kernel parameters are usually tuned and hardened by the system administrators before putting the systems into production. These parameters protect the kernel and the system. Your kubelet kernel defaults that rely on such parameters should be appropriately set to match the desired secured system state. Ignoring this could potentially lead to running pods with undesired kernel behavior. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: When running with the profile flag set to cis-1.6, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --protect-kernel-defaults argument set to true. Ensure that the --make-iptables-util-chains argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kubelets can automatically manage the required changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the pods. It is recommended to let kubelets manage the changes to iptables. This ensures that the iptables configuration remains in sync with pods networking configuration. Manually configuring iptables with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world. You might have iptables rules too restrictive or too open. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify there are no results returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --make-iptables-util-chains argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set (Manual). Rationale Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 does set this parameter for each host, but RKE2 also manages all certificates in the cluster. It ensures the hostname-override is included as a subject alternative name (SAN) in the kubelet’s certificate. Ensure that the --event-qps argument is set to 0 or a level which ensures appropriate event capture (Manual). Rationale It is important to capture all events and not restrict event creation. Events are an important source of security information and analytics that ensure that your environment is consistently monitored using the event data. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: See CIS Benchmark guide for further details on configuring this. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubelet communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the Kubelets to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are present and set appropriately. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments when executing the kubelet process. Ensure that the --rotate-certificates argument is not set to false (Manual). Rationale The --rotate-certificates setting causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there is no downtime due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. This feature also require the RotateKubeletClientCertificate feature gate to be enabled (which is the default since Kubernetes v1.7). Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Manual). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the Kubelet only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Configuration of the parameter is dependent on your use case. Please see the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark for suggestions on configuring this for your use case. Ensure that the cluster-admin role is only used where required (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as cluster-admin provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as cluster-admin allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a ClusterRoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a RoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding’s namespace, including the namespace itself. Result: Pass Remediation: RKE2 does not make inappropriate use of the cluster-admin role. Operators must audit their workloads of additional usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to secrets (Manual). Rationale Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials are stored as secrets. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: RKE2 limits its use of secrets for the system components appropriately, but operators must audit the use of secrets by their workloads. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles (Manual). Rationale The principle of least privilege recommends that users are provided only the access required for their role and nothing more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide excessive rights to the Kubernetes API. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # Retrieve the roles defined across each namespaces in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml # Retrieve the cluster roles defined in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get clusterroles -o yaml Verify that there are not wildcards in use. Remediation: Operators should review their workloads for proper role usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to create pods (Manual). Rationale The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Operators should review who has access to create pods in their cluster. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used. (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. Result: Pass. Audit: For each namespace in the cluster, review the rights assigned to the default service account and ensure that it has no roles or cluster roles bound to it apart from the defaults. Additionally ensure that the automountServiceAccountToken: false setting is in place for each default service account. Remediation: Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access to the Kubernetes API server. Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value automountServiceAccountToken: false Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary (Manual). Rationale Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster. Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: The pods launched by RKE2 are part of the control plane and generally need access to communicate with the API server, thus this control does not apply to them. Operators should review their workloads and take steps to modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace (Automated). Rationale Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit privileged containers. If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl describe psp global-restricted-psp | grep MustRunAsNonRoot Verify that the result is Rule: MustRunAsNonRoot. Remediation: RKE2, when run with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument, will disallow the use of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.hostPID == null) or (.spec.hostPID == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the hostPID value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. When reviewing PSPs, note that the Kubernetes API only displays this field if it is explicitly set to true. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host IPC namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s IPC namespace can use IPC to interact with processes outside the container. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host IPC namespace. If you have a requirement to containers which require hostIPC, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.hostIPC == null) or (.spec.hostIPC == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the HostIPC value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. When reviewing PSPs, note that the Kubernetes API only displays this field if it is explicitly set to true. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s network namespace could access the local loopback device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host network namespace. If you have need to run containers which require hostNetwork, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.hostNetwork == null) or (.spec.hostNetwork == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the HostNetwork value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. When reviewing PSPs, note that the Kubernetes API only displays this field if it is explicitly set to true. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated). Rationale A container running with the allowPrivilegeEscalation flag set to true may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run. If you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == null) or (.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the allowPrivilegeEscalation value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of root containers (Automated). Rationale Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout. Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root users in a container. If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == null) or (.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the runAsUser.Rule value to MustRunAsNonRoot in the PodSecurityPolicy that it creates. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers. Ideally, all containers should drop this capability. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers with the NET_RAW capability from launching. If you need to run containers with this capability, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp global-restricted-psp -o json | jq .spec.requiredDropCapabilities[] Verify the value is \"ALL\". Remediation: RKE2 sets .spec.requiredDropCapabilities[] to a value of All. No manual remediation needed. Minimize the admission of containers with added capabilities (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities outside this set can be added to containers which could expose them to risks of container breakout attacks. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers with capabilities beyond the default set from launching. If you need to run containers with additional capabilities, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp Verify that there are no PSPs present which have allowedCapabilities set to anything other than an empty array. Remediation: When run with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument RKE2 applies a PodSecurityPolicy that sets requiredDropCapabilities to ALL. No manual remediation needed. Minimize the admission of containers with capabilities assigned (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp Remediation: When run with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument RKE2 applies a PodSecurityPolicy that sets requiredDropCapabilities to ALL. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the CNI in use supports Network Policies (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and Egress network policies. Result: Pass Audit: Review the documentation of CNI plugin in use by the cluster, and confirm that it supports Ingress and Egress network policies. Remediation: By default, RKE2 use Canal (Calico and Flannel) and fully supports network policies. Ensure that all Namespaces have Network Policies defined (Automated). Rationale Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. for i in kube-system kube-public default; do /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get networkpolicies -n $i; done Verify that there are network policies applied to each of the namespaces. Remediation: RKE2, when executed with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument applies a secure network policy that only allows intra-namespace traffic and DNS to kube-system. No manual remediation needed. Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables (Manual). Rationale It is reasonably common for application code to log out its environment (particularly in the event of an error). This will include any secret values passed in as environment variables, so secrets can easily be exposed to any user or entity who has access to the logs. Result: Manual Audit: Run the following command to find references to objects which use environment variables defined from secrets. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@..secretKeyRef)]} {.kind} {.metadata.name} {\"\\n\"}{end}' -A Remediation: If possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than from environment variables. Consider external secret storage (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Result: Manual Audit: Review your secrets management implementation. Remediation: Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party secrets management solution. Configure Image Provenance using ImagePolicyWebhook admission controller (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports plugging in provenance rules to accept or reject the images in your deployments. You could configure such rules to ensure that only approved images are deployed in the cluster. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that image provenance is configured as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance. The v1.5.1 guide skips 5.6 and goes from 5.5 to 5.7. We are including it here merely for explanation. These policies relate to general cluster management topics, like namespace best practices and policies applied to pod objects in the cluster. Create administrative boundaries between resources using namespaces (Manual). Rationale Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called default. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command and review the namespaces created in the cluster. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get namespaces Ensure that these namespaces are the ones you need and are adequately administered as per your requirements. Remediation: Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need them. Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in your pod definitions (Manual). Rationale Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster. It should create a line as below: annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default Remediation: Review the Kubernetes documentation and if needed, apply a relevant PodSecurityPolicy. Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers (Manual). Rationale A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark. The default namespace should not be used (Manual). Rationale Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -n default Verify that there are no resources applied to the default namespace. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not utilize the default namespace.","title":"CIS 1.6 Self-Assessment

This document explains how RKE2 is built with FIPS validated cryptographic libraries. Verification of compliance is avaliable in: FIPS 140-2 Verifed. The Go compiler in use can be found here. Each component of the system is built with the version of this compiler that matches the same standard Go compiler version that would be used otherwise. This version of Go replaces the standard Go crypto libraries with the FIPS validated BoringCrypto module. See GoBoring’s readme for more details. This module is validated by NIST as the BoringCrypto module on a wide range of systems. Most of the components of the RKE2 system are statically compiled with the GoBoring Go compiler implementation. RKE2, from a component perspective, is broken up in a number of sections. The list below contains the sections and associated components. Kubernetes API Server Controller Manager Scheduler Kubelet Kube Proxy Metric Server Kubectl Helm Charts Flannel Calico CoreDNS To ensure that all aspects of the system architecture are using FIPS 140-2 compliant algorithm implementations, the RKE2 runtime contains utilities statically compiled with the FIPS enabled Go compiler for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Of these, only Canal (the default) is rebuilt for FIPS compliance. RKE2 ships with NGINX as its default ingress provider. As of v1.21+, this component is FIPS compliant. There are two primary sub-components for NGINX ingress: controller - responsible for monitoring/updating Kubernetes resources and configuring the server accordingly. server - responsible for accepting and routing traffic. The controller is written in Go and as such is compiled using our FIPS compatible Go compiler. The server is written in C and also requires OpenSSL to function properly. As such, it leverages a FIPS-validated version of OpenSSL to achieve FIPS compliance.","title":"FIPS 140-2 Enablement","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"fips_support","url":"/rke2/latest/en/security/fips_support.html","titles":[{"text":"Use of FIPS Compatible Go compiler","hash":"_use_of_fips_compatible_go_compiler","id":1},{"text":"FIPS Support in Cluster Components","hash":"_fips_support_in_cluster_components","id":2},{"text":"Runtime","hash":"_runtime","id":3},{"text":"CNI","hash":"_cni","id":4},{"text":"Ingress","hash":"_ingress","id":5}]},"47":{"id":47,"text":"This document provides prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2. It outlines the configurations and controls required to address Kubernetes benchmark controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS). For more details about evaluating a hardened cluster against the official CIS benchmark, refer to the CIS Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide v1.23, or Self-Assessment Guide v1.6 for RKE2 versions prior to v1.25. RKE2 is designed to be \"hardened by default\" and pass the majority of the Kubernetes CIS controls without modification. There are a few notable exceptions to this that require manual intervention to fully pass the CIS Benchmark: RKE2 will not modify the host operating system. Therefore, you, the operator, must make a few host-level modifications. Certain CIS controls for Network Policies and Pod Security Standards (or Pod Security Policies (PSP) on RKE2 versions prior to v1.25) will restrict the functionality of the cluster. You must opt into having RKE2 configure these for you. To help ensure these requirements are met, RKE2 can be started with the profile flag set to cis, cis-1.23, or cis-1.6 depending on the RKE2 version. This guide assumes that RKE2 has been installed, but is not yet running. If you have already started RKE2, you will need to stop the RKE2 service. There are three areas of host-level requirements: kernel parameters, kubelet’s protect-kernel-defaults and etcd process/directory configuration. These are outlined in this section. CIS benchmark requires some specific kernel parameters configuration to be set. When RKE2 is installed, it creates a sysctl config file to set the required parameters appropriately. However, it does not automatically configure the host to use this configuration. You must do this manually. The location of the config file depends on the installation method used. If RKE2 was installed via RPM, YUM, or DNF (the default on OSes that use RPMs, such as CentOS), run the following commands: sudo cp -f /usr/share/rke2/rke2-cis-sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/60-rke2-cis.conf sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl If RKE2 was installed via the tarball (the default on OSes that do not use RPMs, such as Ubuntu), run the following commands: sudo cp -f /usr/local/share/rke2/rke2-cis-sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/60-rke2-cis.conf sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl If your system lacks the systemd-sysctl.service and/or the /etc/sysctl.d directory, you will want to make sure the sysctls are applied at boot by running the following command during start-up: sudo sysctl -p /usr/local/share/rke2/rke2-cis-sysctl.conf Please perform this step only on fresh installations, before actually using RKE2 to deploy Kubernetes. Many Kubernetes components, including CNI plugins, set up their own sysctls. Restarting the systemd-sysctl service on a running Kubernetes cluster can result in unexpected side-effects. This is a kubelet flag that will cause the kubelet to exit if the required kernel parameters are unset or are set to values that are different from the kubelet’s defaults. RKE2 will automatically set the flag to true when the profile flag is set. protect-kernel-defaults is exposed as a top-level flag for RKE2. If you have set profile to cis-1.XX and protect-kernel-defaults to false explicitly, RKE2 will exit with an error. RKE2 will also check the same kernel parameters that the kubelet does and exit with an error following the same rules as the kubelet. This is done as a convenience to help the operator more quickly and easily identify what kernel parameters are violating the kubelet defaults. The CIS Benchmark requires that the etcd data directory be owned by the etcd user and group. This implicitly requires the etcd process run as the host-level etcd user. To achieve this, RKE2 takes several steps when started with a valid cis or cis-1.XX profile: Check that the etcd user and group exists on the host. If they don’t, exit with an error. Create etcd’s data directory with etcd as the user and group owner. Ensure the etcd process is run as the etcd user and group by setting the etcd static pod’s SecurityContext appropriately. On some Linux distributions, the useradd command will not create a group. The -U flag is included below to account for that. This flag tells useradd to create a group with the same name as the user. sudo useradd -r -c \"etcd user\" -s /sbin/nologin -M etcd -U v1.25 and Newer v1.24 and Older Generic CIS configuration Version Gate Available with October 2023 releases (v1.25.15+rke2r1, v1.26.10+rke2r1, v1.27.7+rke2r1, v1.28.3+rke2r1) profile: \"cis\" Using the generic cis profile will ensure that the cluster passes the CIS benchmark (rke2-cis-1.XX-profile-hardened) associated with the Kubernetes version that RKE2 is running. For example, RKE2 v1.28.XX with the profile: cis will pass the rke2-cis-1.7-profile-hardened in Rancher. Use of the generic cis profile ensures that upgrades to RKE2 do not require a change to existing configuration. Whatever changes are necessary to pass applicable CIS benchmark will be automatically applied. A rough mapping of RKE2 versions to CIS benchmark versions is as follows: CIS Benchmark Applicable RKE2 Minors Profile Flag 1.5 1.15-1.18 cis-1.5 1.6 1.19-1.22 cis-1.6 1.23 1.23 cis-1.23 1.24 1.24 cis-1.23 1.7 1.25-1.28 cis-1.23, cis 1.8 1.29+ cis CIS v1.23 configuration For older versions of 1.25 and 1.26, the cis-1.23 profile is still available. This profile will ensure that the cluster passes the CIS v1.7 benchmark (rke2-cis-1.7-profile-hardened) available in Rancher. yaml profile: \"cis-1.23\" Below is the minimum necessary configuration needed for hardening RKE2 to pass CIS v1.6 hardened profile rke2-cis-1.6-profile-hardened available in Rancher. yaml profile: \"cis-1.6\" # CIS 4.2.6, 5.2.1, 5.2.8, 5.2.9, 5.3.2 The configuration file must be named config.yaml and placed in /etc/rancher/rke2. The directory needs to be created prior to installing RKE2. When the profile flag is set it does the following: v1.25 and Newer v1.24 and Older Checks that host-level requirements have been met. If they haven’t, RKE2 will exit with a fatal error describing the unmet requirements. Applies network policies that allow the cluster to pass associated controls. Configures the Pod Security Admission Controller to enforce restricted mode in all namespaces, with the exception of the kube-system, cis-operator-system, and tigera-operator namespaces. These namespaces are exempted to allow system pods to run without restrictions, which is required for proper operation of the cluster. For more information about the PSA configuration, see the default Pod Security Admission configurations. For more information about Pod Security Standards, please refer to the official documentation. Checks that host-level requirements have been met. If they haven’t, RKE2 will exit with a fatal error describing the unmet requirements. Applies network policies that allow the cluster to pass associated controls. Configures runtime pod security policies that allow the cluster to pass associated controls. The runtime requirements to pass the CIS Benchmark are centered around pod security and network policies. Most of this is automatically handled by RKE2 when using a valid cis-1.XX profile, but some additional operator intervention is required. RKE2 always runs with some amount of pod security. On v1.25 and newer, Pod Security Admission (PSA) are used for pod security. A default Pod Security Admission config file will be added to the cluster upon startup as follows: With the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a restricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce restricted mode throughout the cluster with an exception to the kube-system, cis-operator-system and tigera-operator namespaces to ensure successful operation of system pods. Without the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a nonrestricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce privileged mode throughout the cluster which allows a completely unrestricted mode to all pods in the cluster. See the [Pod Security Policies](pod_security_standards.md) page for more details. v1.25 and Newer v1.24 and Older On v1.25 and newer, Pod Security Admission (PSA) are used for pod security. A default Pod Security Admission config file will be added to the cluster upon startup as follows: With the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a restricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce restricted mode throughout the cluster with an exception to the kube-system, cis-operator-system and tigera-operator namespaces to ensure successful operation of system pods. Without the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a nonrestricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce privileged mode throughout the cluster which allows a completely unrestricted mode to all pods in the cluster. See the [Pod Security Policies](pod_security_standards.md) page for more details. On v1.24 and older, the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller is always enabled. A policy is applied based on the profile passed to RKE2. With the cis-1.6 profile: RKE2 will put a much more restrictive set of policies in place. These policies meet the requirements outlined in section 5.2 of the CIS Benchmark. Without the cis-1.6 profile: RKE2 will put an unrestricted policy in place that allows Kubernetes to run as though the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller was not enabled. See the [Pod Security Policies](pod_security_policies.md) page for more details. The Kubernetes control plane components and critical additions such as CNI, DNS, and Ingress are ran as pods in the kube-system namespace. Therefore, this namespace will have a policy that is less restrictive so that these components can run properly. When ran with a valid \"cis-1.XX\" profile, RKE2 will put NetworkPolicies in place that passes the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes' built-in namespaces. These namespaces are: kube-system, kube-public, and default. The NetworkPolicy used will only allow pods within the same namespace to talk to each other. There are some notable exceptions to this is that it allows DNS requests to be resolved. DNS requests are allowed to reach the dns server HTTP/s requests are allowed to reach the ingress-nginx service HTTPs requests are allowed to reach the metrics-server Requests to the ingress-nginx webhook on the specified pod by the ingress-nginx pod (normally 8443) HTTPs requests to the rke2-snapshot-validation-webhook Operator Intervention Required Operators must manage network policies as normal for additional namespaces that are created. Set automountServiceAccountToken to false for default service accounts. Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. For each namespace including default and kube-system on a standard RKE2 install, the default service account must include this value: automountServiceAccountToken: false RKE2 will automatically set the value correctly for kube-system, cis-operator-system, kube-node-lease and tigera-operator namespaces. Operator Intervention Required For namespaces created by the cluster operator, the following script and configuration file can be used to configure the default service account. The configuration below must be saved to a file called account_update.yaml. apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: default automountServiceAccountToken: false Create a bash script file called account_update.sh. Be sure to sudo chmod +x account_update.sh so the script has execute permissions. #!/bin/bash -e for namespace in $(kubectl get namespaces -A -o=jsonpath=\"{.items[*]['metadata.name']}\"); do echo -n \"Patching namespace $namespace - \" kubectl patch serviceaccount default -n ${namespace} -p \"$(cat account_update.yaml)\" done Execute this script to apply the account_update.yaml configuration to default service account in all namespaces. CIS requirements 1.2.22 to 1.2.25 are related to configuring audit logs for the API Server. When RKE2 is started with the profile flag set, it will automatically configure hardened --audit-log- parameters in the API Server to pass those CIS checks. RKE2’s default audit policy is configured to not log requests in the API Server. This is done to allow cluster operators flexibility to customize an audit policy that suits their auditing requirements and needs, as these are specific to each users' environment and policies. A default audit policy is created by RKE2 when started with the profile flag set. The policy is defined in /etc/rancher/rke2/audit-policy.yaml. apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1 kind: Policy metadata: creationTimestamp: null rules: - level: None Operator Intervention Required To start logging requests to the API Server, at least level parameter must be modified, for example, to Metadata. Detailed information about policy configuration for the API server can be found in the Kubernetes documentation. After adapting the audit policy, RKE2 must be restarted to load the new configuration. sudo systemctl restart rke2-server.service API Server audit logs will be written to /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/logs/audit.log. The following are controls that default RKE2 currently does not pass. Each gap will be explained and how it is addressed. Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd. etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. This can be remediated by creating an etcd user and group as described above. Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. This can be remediated by updating the automountServiceAccountToken field to false for the default service account in each namespace. You can manually update this field on service accounts in your cluster to pass the control as described above. Ensure that all Namespaces have Network Policies defined Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace. This can be remediated by starting RKE2 with the profile flag set in the configuration file as described above. If you have followed this guide, your RKE2 cluster will be configured to pass the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. You can review our CIS Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide v1.6 or v1.23 to understand how we verified each of the benchmarks and how you can do the same on your cluster.","title":"CIS Hardening Guide","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"hardening_guide","url":"/rke2/latest/en/security/hardening_guide.html","titles":[{"text":"Host-level requirements","hash":"_host_level_requirements","id":1},{"text":"Kernel parameters","hash":"_kernel_parameters","id":2},{"text":"Kubelet parameter protect-kernel-defaults is set to true","hash":"_kubelet_parameter_protect_kernel_defaults_is_set_to_true","id":3},{"text":"etcd is configured properly","hash":"_etcd_is_configured_properly","id":4},{"text":"RKE2 configuration","hash":"_rke2_configuration","id":5},{"text":"Kubernetes runtime requirements","hash":"_kubernetes_runtime_requirements","id":6},{"text":"Pod Security","hash":"_pod_security","id":7},{"text":"Network Policies","hash":"_network_policies","id":8},{"text":"Configure default service account","hash":"_configure_default_service_account","id":9},{"text":"API Server audit configuration","hash":"_api_server_audit_configuration","id":10},{"text":"Known issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":11},{"text":"Control 1.1.12","hash":"_control_1_1_12","id":12},{"text":"Rationale","hash":"_rationale","id":13},{"text":"Remediation","hash":"_remediation","id":14},{"text":"Control 5.1.5","hash":"_control_5_1_5","id":15},{"text":"Rationale","hash":"_rationale_2","id":16},{"text":"Remediation","hash":"_remediation_2","id":17},{"text":"Control 5.3.2","hash":"_control_5_3_2","id":18},{"text":"Rationale","hash":"_rationale_3","id":19},{"text":"Remediation","hash":"_remediation_3","id":20},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"_conclusion","id":21}]},"48":{"id":48,"text":"This document describes how RKE2 configures PodSecurityPolicies and NetworkPolicies in order to be secure-by-default while also providing operators with maximum configuration flexibility. Version Gate This document applies to RKE2 v1.24 and older, please refer to the Pod Security Standards Documentation for the default policy information for RKE2 v1.25 and higher. RKE2 can be ran with or without the profile: cis-1.6 configuration parameter. This will cause it to apply different PodSecurityPolicies (PSPs) at start-up. If running with the cis-1.6 profile, RKE2 will apply a restrictive policy called global-restricted-psp to all namespaces except kube-system. The kube-system namespace needs a less restrictive policy named system-unrestricted-psp in order to launch critical components. If running without the cis-1.6 profile, RKE2 will apply a completely unrestricted policy called global-unrestricted-psp, which is the equivalent of running without the PSP admission controller enabled. RKE2 will put these policies in place upon initial startup, but will not modify them after that, unless explicitly triggered by the cluster operator as described below. This is to allow the operator to fully control the PSPs without RKE2’s defaults adding interference. The creation and application of the PSPs are controlled by the presence or absence of certain annotations on the kube-system namespace. These map directly to the PSPs which can be created and are: psp.rke2.io/global-restricted psp.rke2.io/system-unrestricted psp.rke2.io/global-unrestricted The following logic is performed at startup for the policies and their annotations: If the annotation exists, RKE2 continues without further action. If the annotation doesn’t exist, RKE2 checks to see if the associated policy exists and if so, deletes and recreates it, along with adding the annotation to the namespace. In the case of the global-unrestricted-psp, the policy is not recreated. This is to account for moving between CIS and non-CIS modes without making the cluster less secure. At the time of creating a policy, cluster roles and cluster role bindings are also created to ensure the appropriate policies are put into use by default. So, after the initial start-up, operators can modify or delete RKE2’s policies and RKE2 will respect those changes. Additionally, to \"reset\" a policy, an operator just needs to delete the associated annotation from the kube-system namespace and restart RKE2. The policies are outlined below, starting with the most restrictive global-restricted PSP. apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: global-restricted-psp spec: privileged: false # CIS - 5.2.1 allowPrivilegeEscalation: false # CIS - 5.2.5 requiredDropCapabilities: # CIS - 5.2.7/8/9 - ALL volumes: - 'configMap' - 'emptyDir' - 'projected' - 'secret' - 'downwardAPI' - 'persistentVolumeClaim' hostNetwork: false # CIS - 5.2.4 hostIPC: false # CIS - 5.2.3 hostPID: false # CIS - 5.2.2 runAsUser: rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot' # CIS - 5.2.6 seLinux: rule: 'RunAsAny' supplementalGroups: rule: 'MustRunAs' ranges: - min: 1 max: 65535 fsGroup: rule: 'MustRunAs' ranges: - min: 1 max: 65535 readOnlyRootFilesystem: false If RKE2 is started in non CIS mode, annotations are checked like above however the resulting application of pod security policies is a permissive one.

The policy supporting this is a specialization of the container-selinux policy for containerd. It accounts for the non-standard location(s) which containerd is installed and places persistent and ephemeral state. In some circumstances, a reboot of the node may be required after installing the rke2-selinux package and before starting the rke2 service. If you encounter denials in your selinux audit log despite installation of the rke2-selinux and container-selinux packages, please reboot the node. RKE2 runs control-plane services as static pods which require access to multiple container_var_lib_t locations. The etcd container must be able to read-write under /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db and read, along with kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, and kube-scheduler, from /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. To make this work without over-privileging, e.g., spc_t, the RKE2 SELinux policy introduces the rke2_service_db_t and rke2_service_t context labels for read-write and read-only access, respectively. These labels will only be applied to the RKE2 control-plane static pods. RKE2 support for SELinux amounts to a single configuration item, the --selinux boolean flag. This is a pass-through to the enable_selinux boolean in the cri section of the containerd/cri toml. If RKE2 was installed via tarball then SELinux will not be enabled without additional configuration. The recommended method to configure such is via an entry in the RKE2 config.yaml, e.g.: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml is the default location selinux: true This is equivalent to passing the --selinux flag to rke2 server or rke2 agent command-line or setting the RKE2_SELINUX=true environment variable.","title":"SELinux","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"selinux","url":"/rke2/latest/en/security/selinux.html","titles":[{"text":"Custom Context Labels","hash":"_custom_context_labels","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":2}]},"52":{"id":52,"text":"Version Gate Available as of 2023-11 releases (v1.28.3+rke2r2, v1.27.7+rke2r2, v1.26.10+rke2r2, v1.25.15+rke2r2).

This is a Kubernetes-native approach to cluster upgrades. It leverages a custom resource definition (CRD), the plan, and a controller that schedules upgrades based on the configured plans. A plan defines upgrade policies and requirements. This documentation will provide plans with defaults appropriate for upgrading a RKE2 cluster. For more advanced plan configuration options, please review the CRD. The controller schedules upgrades by monitoring plans and selecting nodes to run upgrade jobs on. A plan defines which nodes should be upgraded through a label selector. When a job has run to completion successfully, the controller will label the node on which it ran accordingly. The upgrade job that is launched must be highly privileged. It is configured with the following: Host IPC, NET, and PID namespaces The CAP_SYS_BOOT capability Host root mounted at /host with read and write permissions For more details on the design and architecture of the system-upgrade-controller or its integration with RKE2, see the following Git repositories: system-upgrade-controller rke2-upgrade To automate upgrades in this manner you must: Install the system-upgrade-controller into your cluster Configure plans When attempting to upgrade to a new version of RKE2, the Kubernetes version skew policy applies. Ensure that your plan does not skip intermediate minor versions when upgrading. The system-upgrade-controller itself will not protect against unsupported changes to the Kubernetes version. Automated upgrades are currently not supported on Windows nodes. The system-upgrade-controller can be installed as a deployment into your cluster. The deployment requires a service-account, clusterRoleBinding, and a configmap. To install these components, run the following command: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller/releases/latest/download/system-upgrade-controller.yaml The controller can be configured and customized via the previously mentioned configmap, but the controller must be redeployed for the changes to be applied. To be able to apply plans, the system-upgrade-controller CRD needs to be deployed: kubectl apply -f https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller/releases/latest/download/crd.yaml It is recommended that you minimally create two plans: a plan for upgrading server (master / control-plane) nodes and a plan for upgrading agent (worker) nodes. As needed, you can create additional plans to control the rollout of the upgrade across nodes. The following two example plans will upgrade your cluster to RKE2 v1.30.1+rke2r1. Once the plans are created, the controller will pick them up and begin to upgrade your cluster. # Server plan apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1 kind: Plan metadata: name: server-plan namespace: system-upgrade labels: rke2-upgrade: server spec: concurrency: 1 nodeSelector: matchExpressions: # When using k8s version 1.19 or older, swap control-plane with master - {key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane, operator: In, values: [\"true\"]} tolerations: - key: \"CriticalAddonsOnly\" operator: \"Equal\" value: \"true\" effect: \"NoExecute\" serviceAccountName: system-upgrade cordon: true # drain: # force: true upgrade: image: rancher/rke2-upgrade version: v1.30.1-rke2r1 --- # Agent plan apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1 kind: Plan metadata: name: agent-plan namespace: system-upgrade labels: rke2-upgrade: agent spec: concurrency: 2 nodeSelector: matchExpressions: - {key: beta.kubernetes.io/os, operator: In, values: [\"linux\"]} - {key: rke2-upgrade, operator: Exists} - {key: rke2-upgrade, operator: NotIn, values: [\"disabled\", \"false\"]} # When using k8s version 1.19 or older, swap control-plane with master - {key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane, operator: NotIn, values: [\"true\"]} prepare: args: - prepare - server-plan image: rancher/rke2-upgrade serviceAccountName: system-upgrade cordon: true drain: force: true upgrade: image: rancher/rke2-upgrade version: v1.30.1-rke2r1 There are a few important things to call out regarding these plans: The plans must be created in the same namespace where the controller was deployed. The concurrency field indicates how many nodes can be upgraded at the same time. The server-plan targets server nodes by specifying a label selector that selects nodes with the node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane label (node-role.kubernetes.io/master for 1.19 or older). The agent-plan targets agent nodes by specifying a label selector that select nodes without that label. Optionally, additional labels can be included, like in the example above, which requires label \"rke2-upgrade\" to exist and not have the value \"disabled\" or \"false\". The prepare step in the agent-plan will cause upgrade jobs for that plan to wait for the server-plan to complete before they execute. Both plans have the version field set to v1.30.1+rke2r1. Alternatively, you can omit the version field and set the channel field to a URL that resolves to a release of RKE2. This will cause the controller to monitor that URL and upgrade the cluster any time it resolves to a new release. This works well with the release channels. Thus, you can configure your plans with the following channel to ensure your cluster is always automatically upgraded to the newest stable release of RKE2: apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1 kind: Plan ... spec: ... channel: https://update.rke2.io/v1-release/channels/stable As stated, the upgrade will begin as soon as the controller detects that a plan was created. Updating a plan will cause the controller to re-evaluate the plan and determine if another upgrade is needed. You can monitor the progress of an upgrade by viewing the plan and jobs via kubectl: kubectl -n system-upgrade get plans -o yaml kubectl -n system-upgrade get jobs -o yaml","title":"Automated Upgrades","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"automated_upgrade","url":"/rke2/latest/en/upgrade/automated_upgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"Overview","hash":"_overview","id":1},{"text":"Install the system-upgrade-controller","hash":"_install_the_system_upgrade_controller","id":2},{"text":"Configure plans","hash":"_configure_plans","id":3}]},"54":{"id":54,"text":"You can upgrade RKE2 by using the installation script, by manually installing the binary of the desired version, or by using rpm upgrades in case of rpm installation. Upgrade the server nodes first, one at a time. Once all servers have been upgraded, you may then upgrade agent nodes. Upgrades performed via the installation script or using our automated upgrades feature can be tied to different release channels. The following channels are available: Channel Description stable (Default) Stable is recommended for production environments. These releases have been through a period of community hardening, and are compatible with the most recent release of Rancher. latest Latest is recommended for trying out the latest features. These releases have not yet been through a period of community hardening, and may not be compatible with Rancher. v1.26 (example) There is a release channel tied to each Kubernetes minor version, including versions that are end-of-life. These channels will select the latest patch available, not necessarily a stable release. For an exhaustive and up-to-date list of channels, you can visit the RKE2 channel service API. For more technical details on how channels work, you can see the channelserver project. When attempting to upgrade to a new version of RKE2, the Kubernetes version skew policy applies. Ensure that your plan does not skip intermediate minor versions when upgrading. Nothing in the upgrade process will protect against unsupported changes to the Kubernetes version. To upgrade RKE2 from an older version you can re-run the installation script using the same flags, for example: curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | sh - This will upgrade to the most recent version in the stable channel by default.

If upgrading agent nodes, you should specify name of the rke2-agent package # zypper upgrade zypper update rke2-agent # yum upgrade yum update rke2-agent Remember to restart the RKE2 process after installing: # Server nodes: systemctl restart rke2-server # Agent nodes: systemctl restart rke2-agent In case you enabled rke2-selinux you should also be able to upgrade rke2-selinux to the latest version using: yum update rke2-selinux Restarting RKE2 is supported by the installation script for systemd.

可以配置为连接到私有镜像仓库，并使用仓库在每个节点上拉取私有镜像。 启动时，RKE2 会检查 /etc/rancher/rke2/ 中是否存在 registries.yaml 文件，并指示 containerd 使用该文件中定义的镜像仓库。如果你想使用私有的镜像仓库，你需要在每个使用镜像仓库的节点上以 root 身份创建这个文件。 请注意，server 节点默认是可以调度的。如果你没有在 server 节点上设置污点，而且希望在 server 节点上运行工作负载，请确保在每个 server 节点上创建 registries.yaml 文件。 注意：在 RKE2 v1.20 之前，初始 RKE2 节点引导不支持 containerd 镜像仓库配置，仅可用于节点加入集群后启动的 Kubernetes 工作负载。如果你计划使用此 containerd 镜像仓库功能来引导节点，请参阅离线安装文档。 Containerd 中的配置可以用于通过 TLS 连接到私有镜像仓库，也可以与启用验证的镜像仓库连接。下一节将解释 registries.yaml 文件，并给出在 RKE2 中使用私有镜像仓库配置的不同例子。 该文件由两个主要部分组成： mirrors configs Mirrors 是用于定义私有镜像仓库名称和端点的指令。私有镜像仓库可以用作默认 docker.io 镜像仓库的本地 mirror，也可以用于在名称中指定了镜像仓库的镜像。 例如，以下配置将从位于 https://registry.example.com:5000 的私有镜像仓库中拉取 library/busybox:latest 和 registry.example.com/library/busybox:latest： mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" registry.example.com: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\" 每个 mirror 都必须有一个名称和一组端点。从镜像仓库中拉取镜像时，containerd 会逐个尝试这些端点 URL，并使用第一个有效的 URL。 注意：如果没有配置端点，containerd 假定镜像仓库可以通过 HTTPS 端口 443 进行匿名访问，并且使用主机操作系统信任的证书。有关更多信息，请参阅 containerd 文档。 每个镜像都可以有一组重写。重写可以根据正则表达式来改变镜像的标签。如果 mirror 仓库中的组织/项目结构与上游不同，这将很有用。 例如，以下配置将从 registry.example.com:5000/mirrorproject/rancher-images/rke2-runtime:v1.23.5-rke2r1 无感知地拉取 rancher/rke2-runtime:v1.23.5-rke2r1 镜像： mirrors: docker.io: endpoint: - \"https://registry.example.com:5000\"

etcd、Kubernetes API 和其他 control plane 服务的奇数个（推荐三个）Server 节点 零个或多个 Agent 节点，用于运行你的应用和服务 Agent 通过固定注册地址注册。然而，当 RKE2 启动 kubelet 并且必须连接到 Kubernetes api-server 时，它通过 rke2 agent 进程进行连接，该进程充当客户端负载均衡器。 设置 HA 集群需要以下步骤： 配置固定注册地址 启动第一个 Server 节点 加入额外的 Server 节点 加入 Agent 节点 第一个以外的 Server 节点和所有 Agent 节点都需要一个 URL 来注册。这可以是任何 server 节点的 IP 或主机名，但在许多情况下，随着节点的创建和销毁，它们可能会随着时间的推移而改变。因此，你应该在 Server 节点前面有一个稳定的端点。 你可以使用许多方法来设置此端点，例如： 4 层 (TCP) 负载均衡器 轮询 DNS 虚拟或弹性 IP 地址 这个端点也可以用来访问 Kubernetes API。因此，你可以修改 kubeconfig 文件来指向它，而不是特定的节点。 请注意，rke2 server 进程在端口 9345 上侦听新节点注册。Kubernetes API 照常在端口 6443 上提供服务。你可以相应地配置负载均衡器。 第一个 Server 节点会建立其他 Server 或 Agent 节点在连接集群时用于注册的 Secret 令牌。 要将你自己的预共享 secret 指定为令牌，请在启动时设置 token 参数。 如果你不指定预共享 secret，RKE2 会生成一个预共享 secret 并将它放在 /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/node-token 中。 为了避免固定注册地址的证书错误，请在启动 Server 时设置 tls-san 参数。这个选项在 Server 的 TLS 证书中增加一个额外的主机名或 IP 作为 Subject Alternative Name。如果你想通过 IP 和主机名访问，你可以将它指定为一个列表。 第一台 Server 的 RKE2 配置文件示例： RKE2 配置文件需要手动创建。你可以通过以特权用户身份运行 touch /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml 来实现这一点。 token: my-shared-secret tls-san: - my-kubernetes-domain.com - another-kubernetes-domain.com 默认情况下，Server 节点是可调度的，因此你的工作负载可以在它们上启动。如果你希望拥有一个不会运行用户工作负载的专用 control plane，你可以使用污点（taint）。node-taint 参数允许你配置带有污点的节点。以下是将节点污点添加到配置文件的示例： node-taint: - \"CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute\" 注意：所有节点都具有 CriticalAddonsOnly 污点时，NGINX Ingress 和 Metrics Server 插件将不部署。如果你的 Server 节点有该污点，这些插件将保持挂起状态，直到没有污点的 Agent 节点添加到集群中。 其他 Server 节点的启动与第一个节点非常相似，只是你必须指定 server 和 token 参数，以便它们可以成功连接到初始 Server 节点。 其他 Server 节点的 RKE2 配置文件示例： server: https://my-kubernetes-domain.com:9345 token: my-shared-secret tls-san: - my-kubernetes-domain.com - another-kubernetes-domain.com 如前所述，你的 Server 节点总数必须为奇数。 在所有 Server 节点上启动了 rke2 server 进程后，确保集群已经正常启动，请运行以下命令： /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get nodes \\ --kubeconfig /etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml 你应该看到 server 节点处于 Ready 状态。 默认情况下，任何 kubectl 命令都需要 root 用户访问权限，除非提供了 RKE2_KUBECONFIG_MODE 覆盖。有关更多信息，请参阅集群访问页面。 因为 RKE2 Server 节点默认是可调度的，所以 HA RKE2 Server 集群的最小节点数是三个 Server 节点和零个 Agent 节点。要添加用于运行应用程序和服务的节点，请将 Agent 节点加入到你的集群中。 在 HA 集群中加入 Agent 节点与在单个 Server 集群中加入 Agent

dnf，如果存在任何一个，它会确定系统是基于 Redhat 的，并且启动 RPM 安装过程。 安装文件时使用前缀 /usr 而不是 /usr/local。 RKE2 的签名 RPM 在 rpm-testing.rancher.io 和 rpm.rancher.io RPM 仓库中发布。如果你在支持 RPM 的节点上运行 https://get.rke2.io 脚本，它将默认使用这些 RPM 仓库。你也可以自行安装它们。 RPM 提供 systemd 单元来管理 rke2，但需要在首次启动服务之前通过配置文件进行配置。 要使用 RPM 仓库，在 CentOS 7 或 RHEL 7 系统上运行以下 bash 代码片段： cat /etc/yum.repos.d/rancher-rke2-1-18-latest.repo [rancher-rke2-common-latest] name=Rancher RKE2 Common Latest baseurl=https://rpm.rancher.io/rke2/latest/common/centos/7/noarch enabled=1 gpgcheck=1 gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key [rancher-rke2-1-18-latest] name=Rancher

gpgkey=https://rpm.rancher.io/public.key EOF 配置仓库后，你可以运行以下任一命令： yum -y install rke2-server 或者 yum -y install rke2-agent RPM 将安装相应的 rke2-server.service 或 rke2-agent.service systemd 单元，你可以使用 systemctl start rke2-server 进行调用。请确保在启动之前配置 rke2，可以按照下面的配置文件说明进行操作。 RKE2 二进制文件是静态编译和链接的，这使得 RKE2 二进制文件可以跨 Linux 发行版移植，而无需担心依赖性问题。最简单的安装方法是下载二进制文件，确保文件可执行，然后将其复制到 ${PATH}，通常是 /usr/local/bin。第一次执行后，RKE2 将创建所有必要的目录和文件。要进一步配置系统，请参阅配置文件文档。","title":"安装方法","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"methods","url":"/rke2/latest/zh/install/methods.html","titles":[{"text":"Tarball","hash":"_tarball","id":1},{"text":"安装","hash":"_安装","id":2},{"text":"RPM","hash":"_rpm","id":3},{"text":"仓库","hash":"_仓库","id":4},{"text":"Enterprise

镜像仓库配置中的所有设置。其中包括端点覆盖和传输协议（HTTP/HTTPS）、身份验证、证书验证等。 在 RKE2 v1.20 之前，私有镜像仓库必须使用 TLS，并使用主机 CA 捆绑包信任的证书。如果镜像仓库使用的是自签名证书，你可以使用 update-ca-certificates 将证书添加到主机 CA 捆绑包。镜像仓库还必须允许匿名（未经身份验证）访问。 将所有必需的系统镜像添加到你的私有镜像仓库。你可以从与上述每个压缩包对应的 .txt 文件中获取镜像列表，也可以对离线镜像压缩包使用 docker load，然后标记并推送加载的镜像。 如果在镜像仓库上使用私有或自签名证书，请将镜像仓库的 CA 证书添加到 containerd 镜像仓库配置中，如果使用 v1.20 之前的版本，则添加到操作系统的受信任证书中。 使用

The Canal CNI plugin is the default but all CNI plugins are supported. All CNI plugins get installed via a helm chart after the main components are up and running and can be customized by modifying the helm chart options. RKE2 integrates with four different CNI plugins: Canal, Cilium, Calico and Flannel. Note that only Calico and Flannel are options for RKE2 deployments with Windows nodes. The next tabs inform how to deploy each CNI plugin and override the default options: Canal CNI plugin Cilium CNI plugin Calico CNI plugin Flannel CNI plugin Canal means using Flannel for inter-node traffic and Calico for intra-node traffic and network policies. By default, it will use vxlan encapsulation to create an overlay network among nodes. Canal is deployed by default in RKE2 and thus nothing must be configured to activate it. To override the default Canal options you should create a HelmChartConfig resource. The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart. For example to override the flannel interface, you can apply the following config: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- hubble: enabled: true relay: enabled: true ui: enabled: true Starting with RKE2 v1.23 it is possible to use flannel’s wireguard backend for in-kernel WireGuard encapsulation and encryption Users of kernels = 4.9.17) and they meet the requirements. To override the default options, please use a HelmChartConfig resource. The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart. For example, to enable eni: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- eni: enabled: true For more information about values available in the Cilium chart, please refer to the rke2-charts repository. Cilium includes advanced features to fully replace kube-proxy and implement the routing of services using eBPF instead of iptables. It is not recommended to replace kube-proxy by Cilium if your kernel is not v5.8 or newer, as important bug fixes and features will be missing. To activate this mode, deploy rke2 with the flag --disable-kube-proxy and the following cilium configuration: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- kubeProxyReplacement: true k8sServiceHost: k8sServicePort: For more information, please check the upstream docs.

To deploy Calico as the CNI plugin for RKE2 pass calico as the value of the --cni flag. To override the default options, please use a HelmChartConfig resource. The HelmChartConfig resource must match the name and namespace of its corresponding HelmChart. For example, to change the mtu: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-calico-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-calico namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- installation: calicoNetwork: mtu: 9000 Because of a kernel bug in versions previous to 5.7, by default we are disabling the checksum offload done by the kernel. That config caps TCP performance to ~2.5Gbps. If you require higher throughput and have a kernel version greater than 5.7, you can enable the checksum offloading by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-calico-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-calico namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- felixConfiguration: featureDetectOverride: \"ChecksumOffloadBroken=false\" For more information about values available for the Calico chart, please refer to the rke2-charts repository. Calico requires the iptables or xtables-nft package to be installed on the node. Starting with RKE2 2024 Feb release (v1.29.2, v1.28.7, v1.27.11, v1.26.14), Flannel can be deployed as the CNI plugin. To do so, pass flannel as the value of the --cni flag. Only vxlan backend is supported at this point. Flannel does not support network policies. Therefore, it is not recommended for hardened installations. Flannel support in RKE2 is currently experimental. Do not run it on production systems before extensive testing. IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking enables the allocation of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services. To configure RKE2 in dual-stack mode, in the control-plane nodes, you must set a valid IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack cidr for pods and services. To do so, use the flags --cluster-cidr and --service-cidr for example: #/etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml cluster-cidr: \"10.42.0.0/16,2001:cafe:42::/56\" service-cidr: \"10.43.0.0/16,2001:cafe:43::/112\" Each CNI plugin may require a different configuration for dual-stack: Canal CNI plugin Cilium CNI plugin Calico CNI plugin Flannel CNI plugin Canal automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. Dual-stack is currently not supported in the windows installations of RKE2. Cilium automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. Calico automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. When deployed in dual-stack mode, it creates two different ippool resources. Note that when using dual-stack, calico leverages BGP instead of VXLAN encapsulation. Dual-stack and BGP are currently not supported in the windows installations of RKE2. Flannel automatically detects the RKE2 configuration for dual-stack and does not need any extra configuration. In case of IPv6 only configuration RKE2 needs to use localhost to access the liveness URL of the ETCD pod; check that your operating system configures /etc/hosts file correctly: ::1 localhost Some cloud providers, such as Linode, will create machines with localhost as the hostname and others may not have a hostname set at all. This can cause problems with domain name resolution. You can run RKE2 with the node-name parameter and this will pass the node name to resolve this issue.","title":"Network Options","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"basic_network_options","url":"/rke2/latest/zh/networking/basic_network_options.html","titles":[{"text":"Install a CNI plugin","hash":"_install_a_cni_plugin","id":1},{"text":"Dual-stack configuration","hash":"_dual_stack_configuration","id":2},{"text":"IPv6 setup","hash":"_ipv6_setup","id":3},{"text":"Nodes Without a Hostname","hash":"_nodes_without_a_hostname","id":4}]},"69":{"id":69,"text":"Multus CNI is a CNI plugin that enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. Multus does not replace CNI plugins, instead it acts as a CNI plugin multiplexer. Multus is useful in certain use cases, especially when pods are network intensive and require extra network interfaces that support dataplane acceleration techniques such as SR-IOV. Multus can not be deployed standalone. It always requires at least one conventional CNI plugin that fulfills the Kubernetes cluster network requirements. That CNI plugin becomes the default for Multus, and will be used to provide the primary interface for all pods. To enable Multus, add multus as the first list entry in the cni config key, followed by the name of the plugin you want to use alongside Multus (or none if you will provide your own default plugin). Note that multus must always be in the first position of the list. For example, to use Multus with canal as the default plugin you could specify: # /etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml cni: - multus - canal This can also be specified with command-line arguments, i.e. --cni=multus,canal or --cni=multus --cni=canal. For more information about Multus, refer to the multus-cni documentation. To use Cilium with Multus the exclusive config needs to be disabled. You can do this by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-cilium-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-cilium namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- cni: exclusive: false Any CNI plugin can be used as secondary CNI plugin for Multus to provide additional network interfaces attached to a pod. However, it is most common to use the CNI plugins maintained by the containernetworking team (bridge, host-device, macvlan, etc) as secondary CNI plugins for Multus. These containernetworking plugins are automatically deployed when installing Multus. For more information about these plugins, refer to the containernetworking plugins documentation. To use any of these plugins, a proper NetworkAttachmentDefinition object will need to be created to define the configuration of the secondary network. The definition is then referenced by pod annotations, which Multus will use to provide extra interfaces to that pod. An example using the macvlan cni plugin with Multus is available in the multus-cni repo. host-local Multus DHCP daemon Whereabouts host-local IPAM plugin allocates ip addresses out of a set of address ranges. It stores the state locally on the host filesystem, therefore ensuring uniqueness of IP addresses on a single host. Therefore, we don’t recommend it for multi-node clusters. This IPAM plugin does not require any extra deployment. For more information: https://www.cni.dev/plugins/current/ipam/host-local/. Multus provides an optional daemonset to deploy the DHCP daemon required to run the DHCP IPAM plugin. You can do this by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-multus-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-multus namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- manifests: dhcpDaemonSet: true This will configure the chart for Multus to deploy the DHCP daemonset. This feature is available starting with the 2024-01 releases (v1.29.1+rke2r1, v1.28.6+rke2r1, v1.27.10+rke2r1, v1.26.13+rke2r1). You should write this file before starting RKE2. Whereabouts is an IP Address Management (IPAM) CNI plugin that assigns IP addresses cluster-wide. RKE2 includes the option to use Whereabouts with Multus to manage the IP addresses of the additional interfaces created through Multus. In order to do this, you need to use HelmChartConfig to configure theMultus CNI to use Whereabouts. You can do this by using the following HelmChartConfig: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-multus-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-multus namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- rke2-whereabouts: enabled: true This will configure the chart for Multus to use rke2-whereabouts as a dependency. You should write this file before starting RKE2. SR-IOV experimental support was added in v1.21.2+rke2r1, and is fully supported starting with the April 2023 releases: v1.26.4+rke2r1, v1.25.9+rke2r1, and v1.24.13+rke2r1 Using the SR-IOV CNI with Multus can help with data-plane acceleration use cases, providing an extra interface in the pod that can achieve very high throughput. SR-IOV will not work in all environments, and there are several requirements that must be fulfilled to consider the node as SR-IOV capable: Physical NIC must support SR-IOV (e.g. by checking /sys/class/net/$NIC/device/sriov_totalvfs) The host operating system must activate IOMMU virtualization The host operating system includes drivers capable of doing sriov (e.g. i40e, vfio-pci, etc) The SR-IOV CNI plugin cannot be used as the default CNI plugin for Multus; it must be deployed alongside both Multus and a traditional CNI plugin. The SR-IOV CNI helm chart can be found in the rancher-charts Helm repo. For more information see Rancher Helm Charts documentation. After installing the SR-IOV CNI chart, the SR-IOV operator will be deployed. Then, the user must specify what nodes in the cluster are SR-IOV capable by labeling them with feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true: kubectl label node $NODE-NAME feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true Once labeled, the sriov-network-config Daemonset will deploy a pod to the node to collect information about the network interfaces. That information is available through the sriovnetworknodestates Custom Resource Definition. A couple of minutes after the deployment, there will be one sriovnetworknodestates resource per node, with the name of the node as the resource name. The SR-IOV CNI chart from rancher-charts now includes the node-feature-discovery chart as an automatic dependency. This chart deploys a small daemonset that automatically labels each node based on the capabilities detected on that node. This works for both hardware and software features. In particular, node-feature-discovery can automatically add the label feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable=true when it detects a compatible node. For more information, see the NFD documentation. However, the latest versions of the sriov-network-operator also include a whitelist of supported hardware so sriov will actually be available only with the NICs on that list. If you want to use the SR-IOV CNI with a NIC that is not on the list, you will need to update the supported-nic-ids configMap yourself. For more information about how to use the SR-IOV operator, please refer to sriov-network-operator.","title":"Multus and SR-IOV","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"multus_sriov","url":"/rke2/latest/zh/networking/multus_sriov.html","titles":[{"text":"Using Multus","hash":"_using_multus","id":1},{"text":"Using Multus with Cilium","hash":"_using_multus_with_cilium","id":2},{"text":"Using Multus with the containernetworking plugins","hash":"_using_multus_with_the_containernetworking_plugins","id":3},{"text":"Multus IPAM plugin options","hash":"_multus_ipam_plugin_options","id":4},{"text":"Using Multus with SR-IOV","hash":"_using_multus_with_sr_iov","id":5}]},"70":{"id":70,"text":"This page explains how CoreDNS and the Nginx-Ingress controller work within RKE2. Refer to the Basic Network Options page for details on Canal configuration options, or how to set up your own CNI. For information on which ports need to be opened for RKE2, refer to the Installation Requirements. CoreDNS is deployed by default when starting the server. To disable, run each server with disable: rke2-coredns option in your configuration file. If you don’t install CoreDNS, you will need to install a cluster DNS provider yourself. CoreDNS is deployed with the autoscaler by default. To disable it or change its config, use the HelmChartConfig resource.

Configuration options can be specified by creating a HelmChartConfig manifest to customize the rke2-ingress-nginx HelmChart values. For example, a HelmChartConfig at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-ingress-nginx-config.yaml with the following contents sets use-forwarded-headers to \"true\" in the ConfigMap storing the NGINX config: # /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-ingress-nginx-config.yaml --- apiVersion: helm.cattle.io/v1 kind: HelmChartConfig metadata: name: rke2-ingress-nginx namespace: kube-system spec: valuesContent: |- controller: config: use-forwarded-headers: \"true\" For more information, refer to the official nginx-ingress Helm Configuration Parameters. To disable the NGINX ingress controller, start each server with the disable: rke2-ingress-nginx option in your configuration file. Kubernetes Services can be of type LoadBalancer but it requires an external load balancer controller to implement things correctly and for example,provide the external-ip.

You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at contrib/util/certs.sh. RKE2 now supports kubeadm style join tokens. rke2 token create now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL. RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster. ServiceLB now honors the Service’s ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.

This includes a backported fix for containerd/7843 which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites. This v1.24.9+rke2r1 release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use v1.24.9+rke2r2 instead.

You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at contrib/util/certs.sh. RKE2 now supports kubeadm style join tokens. rke2 token create now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL. RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster. ServiceLB now honors the Service’s ExternalTrafficPolicy. When set to Local, the LoadBalancer will only advertise addresses of Nodes with a Pod for the Service, and will not forward traffic to other cluster members.

You may retrieve the token value from any server already joined to the cluster: cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/token Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 (#3746) The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for containerd/7843 which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites. This v1.25.5+rke2r1 release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use v1.25.5+rke2r2 instead. This release update Kubernetes to v1.25.5+rke2r1, fixes a number of minor issues, and includes security updates. If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the --token CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup.

Please follow the upstream documentation to migrate from PSP if using the built-in PodSecurity Admission Plugin, prior to upgrading to v1.25.0+rke2r1. RKE2 now supports version 1.23 of the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes. The legacy CIS 1.5 and 1.6 profiles (profile: cis-1.5 and profile: cis-1.6) have been removed as they do not apply to Kubernetes 1.25. Servers using one of the legacy profiles must be updated to specify the cis-1.23 profile when upgrading to RKE2 1.25, or RKE2 will fail to start.

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean). If your server (control-plane) nodes were not started with the --token CLI flag or config file key, a randomized token was generated during initial cluster startup. This key is used both for joining new nodes to the cluster, and for encrypting cluster bootstrap data within the datastore. Ensure that you retain a copy of this token, as is required when restoring from backup.

You can find a sample script for generating such certificates before RKE2 starts in the K3s repo at contrib/util/certs.sh. RKE2 now supports kubeadm style join tokens. rke2 token create now creates join token secrets, optionally with a limited TTL. RKE2 agents joined with an expired or deleted token stay in the cluster using existing client certificates via the NodeAuthorization admission plugin, unless their Node object is deleted from the cluster. ServiceLB now honors the Service’s ExternalTrafficPolicy.

Bump containerd to v1.6.14-k3s1 (#3746) The embedded containerd version has been bumped to v1.6.14-k3s1. This includes a backported fix for containerd/7843 which caused pods to lose their CNI info when containerd was restarted, which in turn caused the kubelet to recreate the pod. Windows agents now use the k3s fork of containerd, which includes support for registry rewrites. This v1.26.0+rke2r1 release is RKE2’s first in the v1.26 line. This release updates Kubernetes to v1.26.0. Before upgrading from earlier releases, be sure to read the Kubernetes Urgent Upgrade Notes. This release is affected by https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/7843, which causes the kubelet to restart all pods whenever RKE2 is restarted. For this reason, we have removed this RKE2 release from the channel server. Please use v1.26.0+rke2r2 instead.

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

Canal uses flannel 0.24.3 which includes a bug: every 5 seconds it tries to add ipv6 iptables rules and fails if the node does not have an ipv6 address. The consequence is the log \"Failed to ensure iptables rules: error setting up rules: failed to apply partial iptables-restore unable to run iptables-restore (, ): exit status 4\" appears every 5 seconds in the flannel container of the canal pod. Flannel daemonset is not tolerating node taints: \"node-role.kubernetes.io/etcd:NoExecute\", \"node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule\" and \"node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized:NoSchedule\" which can create problems when deploying with Rancher in certain cloud-providers (e.g. vShpere or DigitalOcean).

Any certificates that are expired, or within 90 days of expiring, are automatically renewed every time RKE2 starts. To rotate client and server certificates manually, use the rke2 certificate rotate subcommand: # Stop RKE2 systemctl stop rke2-server # Rotate certificates rke2 certificate rotate # Start RKE2 systemctl start rke2-server Individual or lists of certificates can be rotated by specifying the certificate name: rke2 certificate rotate --service , The following certificates can be rotated: admin, api-server, controller-manager, scheduler, rke2-controller, rke2-server, cloud-controller, etcd, auth-proxy, kubelet, kube-proxy. Kubernetes requires a number of CA certificates for proper operation. For more information on how Kubernetes uses CA certificates, see the Kubernetes PKI Certificates and Requirements documentation. By default, RKE2 generates self-signed CA certificates during startup of the first server node. These CA certificates are valid for 10 years from date of issuance, and are not automatically renewed. The authoritative CA certificates and keys are stored within the datastore’s bootstrap key, encrypted using the server token as the PBKDF2 passphrase with AES256-GCM and HMAC-SHA1. Copies of the CA certificates and keys are extracted to disk during RKE2 server startup. Any server may generate leaf certificates for nodes as they join the cluster, and the Kubernetes Certificates API controllers may issue additional certificates at runtime. Version Gate Available as of the 2023-02 releases (v1.26.2+rke2r1, v1.25.7+rke2r1, v1.24.11+rke2r1, v1.23.17+rke2r1). To rotate CA certificates and keys, use the rke2 certificate rotate-ca command. This command performs integrity checks to confirm that the updated certificates and keys are usable. If the updated data is acceptable, the datastore’s encrypted bootstrap key is updated, and the new certificates and keys will be used the next time RKE2 starts. If problems are encountered while validating the certificates and keys, an error is reported to the system log and the operation is cancelled without changes. If CA certificates and keys are found the correct location during initial startup of the first server in the cluster, automatic generation of CA certificates will be bypassed. An example script to pre-create the appropriate certificates and keys is available in the K3s repo at contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh. This script should be run prior to starting RKE2 for the first time, and will create a full set of leaf CA certificates signed by common Root and Intermediate CA certificates. If you have an existing Root or Intermediate CA, this script can be used (or used as a starting point) to create the correct CA certificates to provision a RKE2 cluster with PKI rooted in an existing authority. Custom Certificate Authority files must be placed in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. The following files are required: server-ca.crt server-ca.key client-ca.crt client-ca.key request-header-ca.crt request-header-ca.key etcd/peer-ca.crt etcd/peer-ca.key etcd/server-ca.crt etcd/server-ca.key (This is the private key used to sign service-account tokens. It does not have a corresponding certificate.) service.key Custom CA Certificates should observe the following topology: graph TD root(\"Root CA\") intermediate(\"Intermediate CA\") server-ca(\"Server CA\") client-ca(\"Client CA\") request-header-ca(\"API Aggregation CA\") etcd-peer-ca(\"etcd Peer CA\") etcd-server-ca(\"etcd Server CA\") root-hash>\"Join token CA hash\"] kube-server-certs[[\"Kubernetes servers(control-plane and kubelet listeners)\"]] kube-client-certs[[\"Kubernetes clients(apiserver and kubelet clients)\"]] request-header-certs[[\"Kubernetes API aggregation(apiserver proxy client)\"]] etcd-peer-certs[[\"etcd peer client/server(etcd replication)\"]] etcd-server-certs[[\"etcd client/server certificates(Kubernetes etcd)\"]] root -.-|SHA256| root-hash root ---> intermediate intermediate --> server-ca ==> kube-server-certs intermediate --> client-ca ==> kube-client-certs intermediate --> request-header-ca ==> request-header-certs intermediate --> etcd-peer-ca ==> etcd-peer-certs intermediate --> etcd-server-ca ==> etcd-server-certs Important If you want to sign the cluster CA certificates with an existing root CA using the example script, you must place the root and intermediate files in the target directory prior to running the script. If the files do not exist, the script will create new root and intermediate CA certificates. If you want to use only an existing root CA certificate, provide the following files: root-ca.pem root-ca.key If you want to use existing root and intermediate CA certificates, provide the following files: root-ca.pem intermediate-ca.pem intermediate-ca.key To use the example script to generate custom certs and keys before starting RKE2, run the following commands: # Create the target directory for cert generation. mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls # Copy your root CA cert and intermediate CA cert+key into the correct location for the script. # For the purposes of this example, we assume you have existing root and intermediate CA files in /etc/ssl. # If you do not have an existing root and/or intermediate CA, the script will generate them for you. cp /etc/ssl/certs/root-ca.pem /etc/ssl/certs/intermediate-ca.pem /etc/ssl/private/intermediate-ca.key /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls # Generate custom CA certs and keys. curl -sL https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/raw/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh | PRODUCT=rke2 bash - If the command completes successfully, you may install and/or start RKE2 for the first time. If the script generated root and/or intermediate CA files, you should back up these files so that they can be reused if it is necessary to rotate the CA certificates at a later date. To rotate custom CA certificates, use the rke2 certificate rotate-ca subcommand. Updated files must be staged into a temporary directory, loaded into the datastore, and rke2 must be restarted on all nodes to use the updated certificates. You must not overwrite the currently in-use data in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. Stage the updated certificates and keys into a separate directory. A cluster that has been started with custom CA certificates can renew or rotate the CA certificates and keys non-disruptively, as long as the same root CA is used. If a new root CA is required, the rotation will be disruptive. The rke2 certificate rotate-ca --force option must be used, all nodes (servers and agents) will need to be reconfigured to use the new token value, and pods will need to be restarted to trust the new root CA. The example generate-custom-ca-certs.sh script linked above can also be used to generate updated certs in a new temporary directory, by copying files into the correct location and setting the DATA_DIR environment variable. To use the example script to generate updated certs and keys, run the following commands: # Create a temporary directory for cert generation. mkdir -p /opt/rke2/server/tls # Copy your root CA cert and intermediate CA cert+key into the correct location for the script. # Non-disruptive rotation requires the same root CA that was used to generate the original certificates. # If the original files are still in the data directory, you can just run: cp /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/root-ca.* /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/intermediate-ca.* /opt/rke2/server/tls # Copy the current service-account signing key, so that existing service-account tokens are not invalidated. cp /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/service.key /opt/rke2/server/tls # Generate updated custom CA certs and keys. curl -sL https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/raw/master/contrib/util/generate-custom-ca-certs.sh | DATA_DIR=/opt/rke2 PRODUCT=rke2 bash - # Load the updated CA certs and keys into the datastore. rke2 certificate rotate-ca --path=/opt/rke2/server If the rotate-ca command returns an error, check the service log for errors. If the command completes successfully, restart RKE2 on all nodes in the cluster - servers first, then agents. If you used the --force option or changed the root CA, ensure that any nodes that were joined with a secure token are reconfigured to use the new token value, prior to being restarted. The token may be stored in a .env file, systemd unit, or config.yaml, depending on how the node was configured during initial installation. To rotate the RKE2-generated self-signed CA certificates, use the rke2 certificate rotate-ca subcommand. Updated files must be staged into a temporary directory, loaded into the datastore, and rke2 must be restarted on all nodes to use the updated certificates. You must not overwrite the currently in-use data in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. Stage the updated certificates and keys into a separate directory. If the cluster has been started with default self-signed CA certificates, rotation will be disruptive. All nodes that were joined with a secure token will need to be reconfigured to trust the new CA hash. If the new CA certificates are not cross-signed by the old CA certificates, you will need to use the --force option to bypass integrity checks, and pods will need to be restarted to trust the new root CA. The default self-signed CA certificates have the following topology: graph TD server-ca(\"Server CA\") client-ca(\"Client CA\") request-header-ca(\"API Aggregation CA\") etcd-peer-ca(\"etcd Peer CA\") etcd-server-ca(\"etcd Server CA\") root-hash>\"Join token CA hash\"] kube-server-certs[[\"Kubernetes servers(control-plane and kubelet listeners)\"]] kube-client-certs[[\"Kubernetes clients(apiserver and kubelet clients)\"]] request-header-certs[[\"Kubernetes API aggregation(apiserver proxy client)\"]] etcd-peer-certs[[\"etcd peer client/server(etcd replication)\"]] etcd-server-certs[[\"etcd client/server certificates(Kubernetes etcd)\"]] server-ca -.-|SHA256| root-hash server-ca ===> kube-server-certs client-ca ===> kube-client-certs request-header-ca ===> request-header-certs etcd-peer-ca ===> etcd-peer-certs etcd-server-ca ===> etcd-server-certs When rotating the default self-signed CAs, a modified certificate topology with intermediate CAs and a new root CA cross-signed by the old CA can be used so that there is a continuous chain of trust between the old and new CAs: graph TD server-ca-old(\"Server CA(old)\") client-ca-old(\"Client CA(old)\") request-header-ca-old(\"API Aggregation CA(old)\") etcd-peer-ca-old(\"etcd Peer CA(old)\") etcd-server-ca-old(\"etcd Server CA(old)\") root-hash>\"Join token CA hash\"] server-ca-xsigned(\"Server CA(cross-signed)\") client-ca-xsigned(\"Client CA(cross-signed)\") request-header-ca-xsigned(\"API Aggregation CA(cross-signed)\") etcd-peer-ca-xsigned(\"etcd Peer CA(cross-signed)\") etcd-server-ca-xsigned(\"etcd Server CA(cross-signed)\") server-ca-ssigned(\"Server CA(self-signed)\") client-ca-ssigned(\"Client CA(self-signed)\") request-header-ca-ssigned(\"API Aggregation CA(self-signed)\") etcd-peer-ca-ssigned(\"etcd Peer CA(self-signed)\") etcd-server-ca-ssigned(\"etcd Server CA(self-signed)\") server-ca(\"IntermediateServer CA\") client-ca(\"IntermediateClient CA\") request-header-ca(\"IntermediateAPI Aggregation CA\") etcd-peer-ca(\"Intermediateetcd Peer CA\") etcd-server-ca(\"Intermediateetcd Server CA\") kube-server-certs[[\"Kubernetes servers(control-plane and kubelet listeners)\"]] kube-client-certs[[\"Kubernetes clients(apiserver and kubelet clients)\"]] request-header-certs[[\"Kubernetes API aggregation(apiserver proxy client)\"]] etcd-peer-certs[[\"etcd peer client/server(etcd replication)\"]] etcd-server-certs[[\"etcd client/server certificates(Kubernetes etcd)\"]] server-ca-ssigned -.-|SHA256| root-hash server-ca-ssigned --> server-ca ==> kube-server-certs server-ca-old --> server-ca-xsigned --> server-ca client-ca-ssigned --> client-ca ==> kube-client-certs client-ca-old --> client-ca-xsigned --> client-ca request-header-ca-ssigned --> request-header-ca ==> request-header-certs request-header-ca-old --> request-header-ca-xsigned --> request-header-ca etcd-peer-ca-ssigned --> etcd-peer-ca ==> etcd-peer-certs etcd-peer-ca-old --> etcd-peer-ca-xsigned --> etcd-peer-ca etcd-server-ca-ssigned --> etcd-server-ca ==> etcd-server-certs etcd-server-ca-old --> etcd-server-ca-xsigned --> etcd-server-ca An example script to create updated CA certificates and keys cross-signed by the existing CAs is available in the K3s repo at contrib/util/rotate-default-ca-certs.sh. To use the example script to generate updated self-signed certificates that are cross-signed by the existing CAs, run the following commands: # Create updated CA certs and keys, cross-signed by the current CAs. # This script will create a new temporary directory containing the updated certs, and output the new token values. curl -sL https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/raw/master/contrib/util/rotate-default-ca-certs.sh | PRODUCT=rke2 bash - # Load the updated certs into the datastore; see the script output for the updated token values. rke2 certificate rotate-ca --path=/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/rotate-ca If the rotate-ca command returns an error, check the service log for errors. If the command completes successfully, restart RKE2 on all nodes in the cluster - servers first, then agents. Ensure that any nodes that were joined with a secure token, including other server nodes, are reconfigured to use the new token value prior to being restarted. The token may be stored in a .env file, systemd unit, or config.yaml, depending on how the node was configured during initial installation. The service-account issuer key is an RSA private key used to sign service-account tokens. When rotating the service-account issuer key, at least one old key should be retained in the file so that existing service-account tokens are not invalidated. It can be rotated independent of the cluster CAs by using the rke2 certificate rotate-ca to install only an updated service.key file that includes both the new and old keys. You must not overwrite the currently in-use data in /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls. Stage the updated key into a separate directory. For example, to rotate only the service-account issuer key, run the following commands: # Create a temporary directory for cert generation mkdir -p /opt/rke2/server/tls # Check OpenSSL version openssl version | grep -qF 'OpenSSL 3' && OPENSSL_GENRSA_FLAGS=-traditional # Generate a new key openssl genrsa ${OPENSSL_GENRSA_FLAGS:-} -out /opt/rke2/server/tls/service.key 2048 # Append the existing key to avoid invalidating current tokens cat /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/service.key >> /opt/rke2/server/tls/service.key # Load the updated key into the datastore rke2 certificate rotate-ca --path=/opt/rke2/server It is normal to see warnings for files that are not being updated. If the rotate-ca command returns an error, check the service log for errors. If the command completes successfully, restart RKE2 on all servers in the cluster. It is not necessary to restart agents or restart any pods.","title":"Certificate Management","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"certificates","url":"/rke2/latest/zh/security/certificates.html","titles":[{"text":"Client and Server Certificates","hash":"_client_and_server_certificates","id":1},{"text":"Rotating Client and Server Certificates Manually","hash":"_rotating_client_and_server_certificates_manually","id":2},{"text":"Certificate Authority (CA) Certificates","hash":"_certificate_authority_ca_certificates","id":3},{"text":"Rotating CA Certificates","hash":"_rotating_ca_certificates","id":4},{"text":"Using Custom CA Certificates","hash":"_using_custom_ca_certificates","id":5},{"text":"Custom CA Topology","hash":"_custom_ca_topology","id":6},{"text":"Using the Example Script","hash":"_using_the_example_script","id":7},{"text":"Rotating Custom CA Certificates","hash":"_rotating_custom_ca_certificates","id":8},{"text":"Using the Example Script","hash":"_using_the_example_script_2","id":9},{"text":"Rotating Self-Signed CA Certificates","hash":"_rotating_self_signed_ca_certificates","id":10},{"text":"Default CA Topology","hash":"_default_ca_topology","id":11},{"text":"Using The Example Script","hash":"_using_the_example_script_3","id":12},{"text":"Service-Account Issuer Key Rotation","hash":"_service_account_issuer_key_rotation","id":13}]},"88":{"id":88,"text":"This document is a companion to the RKE2 security hardening guide. The hardening guide provides prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2, and this benchmark guide is meant to help you evaluate the level of security of the hardened cluster against each control in the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. It is to be used by RKE2 operators, security teams, auditors, and decision makers. This guide is specific to the v1.25 release line of RKE2 and the v1.23 release of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. For more details about each control, including detailed descriptions and remediations for failing tests, you can refer to the corresponding section of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.23 You can download the benchmark after logging in to CISecurity.org. Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated against an RKE2 cluster that was configured according to the accompanying hardening guide. Where control audits differ from the original CIS benchmark, the audit commands specific to RKE2 are provided for testing. These are the possible results for each control: Pass - The RKE2 cluster under test passed the audit outlined in the benchmark. Not Applicable - The control is not applicable to RKE2 because of how it is designed to operate. The remediation section will explain why this is so. Manual - Operator Dependent - The control is Manual in the CIS benchmark and it depends on the cluster’s use case or some other factor that must be determined by the cluster operator. These controls have been evaluated to ensure RKE2 does not prevent their implementation, but no further configuration or auditing of the cluster under test has been performed.

No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the Container Network Interface file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal.yaml 644 Remediation: RKE2 deploys the default CNI, Canal, using a Helm chart. The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the Container Network Interface file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal.yaml root:root Remediation: RKE2 deploys the default CNI, Canal, using a Helm chart. The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd 700 Remediation: RKE2 manages the etcd data directory and sets its permissions to 700. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd etcd:etcd Remediation: When running RKE2 with the profile flag set to cis-1.23, RKE2 will refuse to start if the etcd user and group doesn’t exist on the host. If it does exist, RKE2 will automatically set the ownership of the etcd data directory to etcd:etcd and ensure the etcd static pod is started with that user and group. Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The admin.conf is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various settings for the administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig and automatically sets its permissions to 644. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admin.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The admin.conf file contains the admin credentials for the cluster. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/admin.kubeconfig and automatically sets its ownership to root:root. Ensure that the scheduler.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The scheduler.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig and automatically sets its permissions to 644. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the scheduler.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The scheduler.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/scheduler.kubeconfig and automatically sets its ownership to root:root. Ensure that the controller.kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The controller.kubeconfig file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig and automatically sets its permissions to 644. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the controller.kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The controller.kubeconfig file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. In RKE2, this file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates this file at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/controller.kubeconfig and automatically sets its ownership to root:root. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the directory and files with the expected ownership of root:root. No manual remediation should be necessary. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI certificate file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 644 or more restrictive to protect their integrity. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.crt Verify that the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 644. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600 (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 600 to protect their integrity and confidentiality. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.key Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 600. No manual remediation is needed. This section contains recommendations relating to API server configuration flags Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Manual). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. If you are using RBAC authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this recommendation is Manual. However, you should consider whether anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that --anonymous-auth=false is present. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is configured to run with this flag and value. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --token-auth-file parameter is not set (Automated). Rationale The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --token-auth-file argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not run with token authentication enabled. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --DenyServiceExternalIPs is not set (Automated). Rationale This admission controller rejects all net-new usage of the Service field externalIPs. This feature is very powerful (allows network traffic interception) and not well controlled by policy. When enabled, users of the cluster may not create new Services which use externalIPs and may not add new values to externalIPs on existing Service objects. Existing uses of externalIPs are not affected, and users may remove values from externalIPs on existing Service objects. Most users do not need this feature at all, and cluster admins should consider disabling it. Clusters that do need to use this feature should consider using some custom policy to manage usage of it. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument does not have DenyServiceExternalIPs. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set DenyServiceExternalIPs to the admission plugin flag. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Connections from apiserver to kubelets could potentially carry sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is thus important to use in-transit encryption for any communication between the apiserver and kubelets. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-https argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver doesn’t run with the --kubelet-https parameter as it runs with TLS. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate- based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with these arguments for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with this argument for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the argument value doesn’t contain AlwaysAllow. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes Node (Automated). Rationale The Node authorization mode only allows kubelets to read Secret, ConfigMap, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim objects associated with their nodes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify Node exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated). Rationale Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify RBAC exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin EventRateLimit is set (Manual). Rationale Using EventRateLimit admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept. This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes EventRateLimit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit allows all requests and do not filter any requests. The AlwaysAdmit admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set, its value does not include AlwaysAdmit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysPullImages is set (Manual). Rationale Setting admission control policy to AlwaysPullImages forces every new pod to pull the required images every time. In a multi-tenant cluster users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by knowing the image’s name, without any authorization check against the image ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are required. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes AlwaysPullImages. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy is not used (Manual). Rationale SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes SecurityContextDeny, if PodSecurityPolicy is not included. Remediation: By default, RKE2 automatically enables the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin. Therefore, the SecurityContextDeny plugin need not be enabled. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set (Automated). Rationale When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not includes ServiceAccount. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. If there’s a desire to use this argument, follow the documentation and create ServiceAccount objects as per your environment. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin NamespaceLifecycle is set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control policy to NamespaceLifecycle ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not include NamespaceLifecycle. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set (Automated). Rationale Using the NodeRestriction plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the Node and Pod objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own Node API object, and only modify Pod API objects that are bound to their node. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes NodeRestriction. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The secure port is used to serve https with authentication and authorization. If you disable it, no https traffic is served and all traffic is served unencrypted. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --secure-port argument is either not set or is set to an integer value between 1 and 65535. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the parameter of 6443 for the --secure-port argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-path argument is set (Automated). Rationale Auditing the Kubernetes API Server provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators or other components of the system. Even though currently, Kubernetes provides only basic audit capabilities, it should be enabled. You can enable it by setting an appropriate audit log path. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-path argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-path argument and parameter. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that you can go back in time and investigate or correlate any events. Set your audit log retention period to 30 days or as per your business requirements. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxage argument parameter to 30. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. For example, if you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxbackup argument parameter to 10. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxsize argument parameter to 100. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --request-timeout argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Setting global request timeout allows extending the API server request timeout limit to a duration appropriate to the user’s connection speed. By default, it is set to 60 seconds which might be problematic on slower connections making cluster resources inaccessible once the data volume for requests exceeds what can be transmitted in 60 seconds. But, setting this timeout limit to be too large can exhaust the API server resources making it prone to Denial-of-Service attack. Hence, it is recommended to set this limit as appropriate and change the default limit of 60 seconds only if needed. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --request-timeout argument is either not set or set to an appropriate value. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --request-timeout argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-lookup argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale If --service-account-lookup is not enabled, the apiserver only verifies that the authentication token is valid, and does not validate that the service account token mentioned in the request is actually present in etcd. This allows using a service account token even after the corresponding service account is deleted. This is an example of time of check to time of use security issue. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --service-account-lookup argument exists it is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 doesn’t set this argument in favor of taking the default effect. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale By default, if no --service-account-key-file is specified to the apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be specified to the apiserver with --service-account-key-file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-key-file argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-key-file explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate and key. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If --client-ca-file argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the client-ca-file is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --client-ca-file argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-cafile argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a SSL Certificate Authority file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-cafile argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-cafile argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set to a EncryptionConfigfile. Additionally, ensure that the EncryptionConfigfile has all the desired resources covered especially any secrets. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --encryption-provider-config argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. RKE2’s default encryption provider config file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json and is configured to encrypt secrets. Ensure that encryption providers are appropriately configured (Automated). Rationale Where etcd encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the aescbc, kms and secretbox are likely to be appropriate options. Result: Pass Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a EncryptionConfig file. In this file, choose aescbc, kms or secretbox as the encryption provider. Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep aescbc /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json Run the below command on the master node. Verify that aescbc is set as the encryption provider for all the desired resources. Remediation By default, RKE2 sets the argument --encryption-provider-config and parameter. The contents of the config file indicates the use of aescbc. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the API Server only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cipher-suites argument is set as outlined in the remediation procedure below. Remediation: By default, RKE2 explicitly doesn’t set this flag. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate (Manual). Rationale Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case, the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The current setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which might be too high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage collection. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument with a value of 1000. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale The controller manager creates a service account per controller in the kube-system namespace, generates a credential for it, and builds a dedicated API client with that service account credential for each controller loop to use. Setting the --use-service-account-credentials to true runs each control loop within the controller manager using a separate service account credential. When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --use-service-account-credentials argument to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with --service-account-private-key-file as appropriate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-private-key-file argument with the service account key file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API server’s serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Providing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate to the controller manager with the --root-ca-file argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --root-ca-file argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --root-ca-file argument with the root ca file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that RotateKubeletServerCertificateargument exists and is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section contains recommendations relating to Scheduler configuration flags Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section covers recommendations for etcd configuration. Ensure that the cert-file and key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'cert-file|key-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the cert-file and the key-file fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Server and peer cert and key files are specified. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the client-cert-auth field is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the client-cert-auth field is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. client-cert-auth is set to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the auto-tls argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-cert-file and peer-key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit and also amongst peers in the etcd clusters. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'peer-server-client.crt|peer-server-client.key' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-client-cert-auth argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'peer-client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the peer-client-cert-auth field in the peer section is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the client-cert-auth field is set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Hence, do not use self- signed certificates for authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'peer-auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the peer-auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the peer-auto-tls field. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that a unique Certificate Authority is used for etcd (Manual). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. Its access should be restricted to specifically designated clients and peers only. Authentication to etcd is based on whether the certificate presented was issued by a trusted certificate authority. There is no checking of certificate attributes such as common name or subject alternative name. As such, if any attackers were able to gain access to any certificate issued by the trusted certificate authority, they would be able to gain full access to the etcd database. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # To find the ca file used by etcd: grep 'trusted-ca-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config # To find the kube-apiserver process: /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the file referenced by the client-ca-file flag in the apiserver process is different from the file referenced by the trusted-ca-file parameter in the etcd configuration file. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config and the trusted-ca-file parameters in it are set to unique values specific to etcd. No manual remediation needed. Client certificate authentication should not be used for users (Manual). Rationale With any authentication mechanism the ability to revoke credentials if they are compromised or no longer required, is a key control. Kubernetes client certificate authentication does not allow for this due to a lack of support for certificate revocation. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of Kubernetes client certificate authentication. Remediation: Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented in place of client certificates. Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created (Automated). Rationale Logging is an important detective control for all systems, to detect potential unauthorised access. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-policy-file is set. Review the contents of the file specified and ensure that it contains a valid audit policy. Remediation: Create an audit policy file for your cluster. Ensure that the audit policy covers key security concerns (Manual). Rationale Security audit logs should cover access and modification of key resources in the cluster, to enable them to form an effective part of a security environment. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The kube-proxy kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. It is possible to run kube-proxy with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml 644 Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubeconfig file for kube-proxy controls various parameters for the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml root:root Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the certificate authorities file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt 644 Verify that the permissions are 644. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt with 644 permissions. Ensure that the client certificate authorities file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt with root:root ownership. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file has permissions set to 600 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. This section contains recommendations for kubelet configuration. Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the value for --anonymous-auth is false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts kubelet with --anonymous-auth set to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that AlwaysAllow is not present. Remediation: RKE2 starts kubelet with Webhook as the value for the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument has a ca file associated. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --client-ca-file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --read-only-port argument set to 0. Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports. By default, --streaming-connection-idle-timeout is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that there’s nothing returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set --streaming-connection-idle-timeout when starting kubelet. Ensure that the --protect-kernel-defaults argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kernel parameters are usually tuned and hardened by the system administrators before putting the systems into production. These parameters protect the kernel and the system. Your kubelet kernel defaults that rely on such parameters should be appropriately set to match the desired secured system state. Ignoring this could potentially lead to running pods with undesired kernel behavior. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: When running with the profile flag set to cis-1.23, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --protect-kernel-defaults argument set to true. Ensure that the --make-iptables-util-chains argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kubelets can automatically manage the required changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the pods. It is recommended to let kubelets manage the changes to iptables. This ensures that the iptables configuration remains in sync with pods networking configuration. Manually configuring iptables with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world. You might have iptables rules too restrictive or too open. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify there are no results returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --make-iptables-util-chains argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set (Manual). Rationale Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 does set this parameter for each host, but RKE2 also manages all certificates in the cluster. It ensures the hostname-override is included as a subject alternative name (SAN) in the kubelet’s certificate. Ensure that the --event-qps argument is set to 0 or a level which ensures appropriate event capture (Manual). Rationale It is important to capture all events and not restrict event creation. Events are an important source of security information and analytics that ensure that your environment is consistently monitored using the event data. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: See CIS Benchmark guide for further details on configuring this. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubelet communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the Kubelets to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are present and set appropriately. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments when executing the kubelet process. Ensure that the --rotate-certificates argument is not set to false (Manual). Rationale The --rotate-certificates setting causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there is no downtime due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. This feature also require the RotateKubeletClientCertificate feature gate to be enabled (which is the default since Kubernetes v1.7). Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Manual). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the Kubelet only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Configuration of the parameter is dependent on your use case. Please see the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark for suggestions on configuring this for your use case. Ensure that the cluster-admin role is only used where required (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as cluster-admin provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as cluster-admin allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a ClusterRoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a RoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding’s namespace, including the namespace itself. Result: Pass Remediation: RKE2 does not make inappropriate use of the cluster-admin role. Operators must audit their workloads of additional usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to secrets (Manual). Rationale Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials are stored as secrets. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: RKE2 limits its use of secrets for the system components appropriately, but operators must audit the use of secrets by their workloads. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles (Manual). Rationale The principle of least privilege recommends that users are provided only the access required for their role and nothing more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide excessive rights to the Kubernetes API. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # Retrieve the roles defined across each namespaces in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml # Retrieve the cluster roles defined in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get clusterroles -o yaml Verify that there are not wildcards in use. Remediation: Operators should review their workloads for proper role usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to create pods (Manual). Rationale The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Operators should review who has access to create pods in their cluster. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used. (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. Result: Pass. Audit: For each namespace in the cluster, review the rights assigned to the default service account and ensure that it has no roles or cluster roles bound to it apart from the defaults. Additionally ensure that the automountServiceAccountToken: false setting is in place for each default service account. Remediation: Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access to the Kubernetes API server. Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value automountServiceAccountToken: false Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary (Manual). Rationale Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster. Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: The pods launched by RKE2 are part of the control plane and generally need access to communicate with the API server, thus this control does not apply to them. Operators should review their workloads and take steps to modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it. Avoid use of system:masters group (Manual). Rationale The system:masters group has unrestricted access to the Kubernetes API hard-coded into the API server source code. An authenticated user who is a member of this group cannot have their access reduced, even if all bindings and cluster role bindings which mention it, are removed. When combined with client certificate authentication, use of this group can allow for irrevocable cluster-admin level credentials to exist for a cluster. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Remove the system:masters group from all users in the cluster. Limit use of the Bind, Impersonate and Escalate permissions in the Kubernetes cluster (Manual). Rationale The impersonate privilege allows a subject to impersonate other users gaining their rights to the cluster. The bind privilege allows the subject to add a binding to a cluster role or role which escalates their effective permissions in the cluster. The escalate privilege allows a subject to modify cluster roles to which they are bound, increasing their rights to that level. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Where possible, remove the impersonate, bind and escalate rights from subjects. Ensure that the cluster has at least one active policy control mechanism in place (Manual). Rationale Without an active policy control mechanism, it is not possible to limit the use of containers with access to underlying cluster nodes, via mechanisms like privileged containers, or the use of hostPath volume mounts. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: PSA is enabled since v1.23 by default in RKE2, no remediation necessary. Minimize the admission of privileged containers (Manual). Rationale A container running in the host’s PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node to ensure restricted level is enabled in the config file. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host IPC namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s IPC namespace can use IPC to interact with processes outside the container. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host IPC namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostIPC, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s network namespace could access the local loopback device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to share the host network namespace. If you need to run containers which require access to the host’s network namespaces, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of hostNetwork containers. Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated). Rationale A container running with the allowPrivilegeEscalation flag set to true may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run. If you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers with .spec.allowPrivilegeEscalationset to true. Minimize the admission of root containers (Automated). Rationale Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout. Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit root containers. If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted Remediation: Create a policy for each namespace in the cluster, ensuring that either MustRunAsNonRoot or MustRunAs with the range of UIDs not including 0, is set. Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability (Automated). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers. Ideally, all containers should drop this capability. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers with the NET_RAW capability. If you need to run containers with this capability, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. config_file=$(ps aux | grep kube-apiserver | grep -- --admission-control-config-file | sed 's%.*admission-control-config-file[= ]\\([^ ]*\\).*%\\1%') grep \"enforce:\" ${config_file} Verify that the returned value is enforce: restricted. Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability. Minimize the admission of containers with added capabilities (Automated). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities outside this set can be added to containers which could expose them to risks of container breakout attacks. There should be at least one policy defined which prevents containers with capabilities beyond the default set from launching. If you need to run containers with additional capabilities, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Manual Remediation: Ensure that allowedCapabilities is not present in policies for the cluster unless it is set to an empty array. Minimize the admission of containers with capabilities assigned (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized. Result: Manual Remediation: Review the use of capabilities in applications running on your cluster. Where a namespace contains applications which do not require any Linux capabilities to operate consider adding a PSP which forbids the admission of containers which do not drop all capabilities. Minimize the admission of Windows HostProcess containers (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized. Result: Manual Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers that have .securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess set to true. Minimize the admission of HostPath volumes (Manual). Rationale A container which mounts a hostPath volume as part of its specification will have access to the filesystem of the underlying cluster node. The use of hostPath volumes may allow containers access to privileged areas of the node filesystem. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers to mount hostPath volumes. If you need to run containers which require hostPath volumes, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Manual Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers with hostPath volumes. Minimize the admission of containers which use HostPorts (Manual). Rationale Host ports connect containers directly to the host’s network. This can bypass controls such as network policy. There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not permit containers which require the use of HostPorts. If you need to run containers which require HostPorts, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy. Result: Manual Remediation: Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of containers which use hostPort sections. Ensure that the CNI in use supports Network Policies (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and Egress network policies. Result: Pass Audit: Review the documentation of CNI plugin in use by the cluster, and confirm that it supports Ingress and Egress network policies. Remediation: By default, RKE2 use Canal (Calico and Flannel) and fully supports network policies. Ensure that all Namespaces have Network Policies defined (Automated). Rationale Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. for i in kube-system kube-public default; do /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get networkpolicies -n $i; done Verify that there are network policies applied to each of the namespaces. Remediation: RKE2, when executed with the --profile=cis-1.23 argument applies a secure network policy that only allows intra-namespace traffic and DNS to kube-system. No manual remediation needed. Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables (Manual). Rationale It is reasonably common for application code to log out its environment (particularly in the event of an error). This will include any secret values passed in as environment variables, so secrets can easily be exposed to any user or entity who has access to the logs. Result: Manual Audit: Run the following command to find references to objects which use environment variables defined from secrets. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@..secretKeyRef)]} {.kind} {.metadata.name} {\"\\n\"}{end}' -A Remediation: If possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than from environment variables. Consider external secret storage (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Result: Manual Audit: Review your secrets management implementation. Remediation: Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party secrets management solution. Configure Image Provenance using ImagePolicyWebhook admission controller (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports plugging in provenance rules to accept or reject the images in your deployments. You could configure such rules to ensure that only approved images are deployed in the cluster. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that image provenance is configured as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance. The v1.23 guide skips 5.6 and goes from 5.5 to 5.7. We are including it here merely for explanation. These policies relate to general cluster management topics, like namespace best practices and policies applied to pod objects in the cluster. Create administrative boundaries between resources using namespaces (Manual). Rationale Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called default. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command and review the namespaces created in the cluster. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get namespaces Ensure that these namespaces are the ones you need and are adequately administered as per your requirements. Remediation: Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need them. Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in your pod definitions (Manual). Rationale Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster. It should create a line as below: annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default Remediation: Review the Kubernetes documentation and if needed, apply a relevant PodSecurityPolicy. Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers (Manual). Rationale A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark. The default namespace should not be used (Manual). Rationale Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -n default Verify that there are no resources applied to the default namespace. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not utilize the default namespace.","title":"CIS 1.23 Self-Assessment

document is a companion to the RKE2 security hardening guide. The hardening guide provides prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2, and this benchmark guide is meant to help you evaluate the level of security of the hardened cluster against each control in the CIS Kubernetes benchmark. It is to be used by RKE2 operators, security teams, auditors, and decision makers. This guide is specific to the v1.20 release line of RKE2 and the v1.6.1 release of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. For more detail about each control, including more detailed descriptions and remediations for failing tests, you can refer to the corresponding section of the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6. You can download the benchmark after logging in to CISecurity.org. Each control in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark was evaluated against an RKE2 cluster that was configured according to the accompanying hardening guide. Where control audits differ from the original CIS benchmark, the audit commands specific to RKE2 are provided for testing. These are the possible results for each control: Pass - The RKE2 cluster under test passed the audit outlined in the benchmark. Not Applicable - The control is not applicable to RKE2 because of how it is designed to operate. The remediation section will explain why this is so. Manual - Operator Dependent - The control is Manual in the CIS benchmark and it depends on the cluster’s use case or some other factor that must be determined by the cluster operator. These controls have been evaluated to ensure RKE2 does not prevent their implementation, but no further configuration or auditing of the cluster under test has been performed. Ensure that the API server pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated).

The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the Container Network Interface file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale Container Network Interface provides various networking options for overlay networking. You should consult their documentation and restrict their respective file permissions to maintain the integrity of those files. Those files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-canal.yml root:root Remediation: RKE2 deploys the default CNI, Canal, using a Helm chart. The chart is defined as a custom resource in a file with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory permissions are set to 700 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should not be readable or writable by any group members or the world. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd 700 Remediation: RKE2 manages the etcd data directory and sets its permissions to 700. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd etcd:etcd Remediation: When running RKE2 with the profile flag set to cis-1.6, RKE2 will refuse to start if the etcd user and group doesn’t exist on the host. If it does exist, RKE2 will automatically set the ownership of the etcd data directory to etcd:etcd and ensure the etcd static pod is started with that user and group. Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The admin.conf is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various settings for the administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the directory and files with the expected ownership of root:root. No manual remediation should be necessary. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI certificate file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 644 or more restrictive to protect their integrity. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.crt Verify that the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 644. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600 (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to 600 to protect their integrity and confidentiality. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %n\\ %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/*.key Verify that the permissions are 600 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates the files with the expected permissions of 600. No manual remediation is needed. This section contains recommendations relating to API server configuration flags Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Manual). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. If you are using RBAC authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this recommendation is Manual. However, you should consider whether anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that --anonymous-auth=false is present. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is configured to run with this flag and value. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --basic-auth-file argument is not set (Automated). Rationale Basic authentication uses plaintext credentials for authentication. Currently, the basic authentication credentials last indefinitely, and the password cannot be changed without restarting the API server. The basic authentication is currently supported for convenience. Hence, basic authentication should not be used. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --basic-auth-file argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not run with basic authentication enabled. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --token-auth-file parameter is not set (Automated). Rationale The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --token-auth-file argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not run with basic authentication enabled. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Connections from apiserver to kubelets could potentially carry sensitive data such as secrets and keys. It is thus important to use in-transit encryption for any communication between the apiserver and kubelets. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-https argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver doesn’t run with the --kubelet-https parameter as it runs with TLS. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The apiserver, by default, does not authenticate itself to the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoints. The requests from the apiserver are treated anonymously. You should set up certificate- based kubelet authentication to ensure that the apiserver authenticates itself to kubelets when submitting requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-client-certificate and --kubelet-client-key arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with these arguments for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --kubelet-certificate-authority argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 kube-apiserver is ran with this argument for secure communication with kubelet. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale The API Server, can be configured to allow all requests. This mode should not be used on any production cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the argument value doesn’t contain AlwaysAllow. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes Node (Automated). Rationale The Node authorization mode only allows kubelets to read Secret, ConfigMap, PersistentVolume, and PersistentVolumeClaim objects associated with their nodes. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify Node exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument includes RBAC (Automated). Rationale Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify RBAC exists as a parameter to the argument. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets Node,RBAC as the parameter to the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin EventRateLimit is set (Manual). Rationale Using EventRateLimit admission control enforces a limit on the number of events that the API Server will accept in a given time slice. A misbehaving workload could overwhelm and DoS the API Server, making it unavailable. This particularly applies to a multi-tenant cluster, where there might be a small percentage of misbehaving tenants which could have a significant impact on the performance of the cluster overall. Hence, it is recommended to limit the rate of events that the API server will accept. This is an Alpha feature in the Kubernetes 1.15 release. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes EventRateLimit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit allows all requests and do not filter any requests. The AlwaysAdmit admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set, its value does not include AlwaysAdmit. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysPullImages is set (Manual). Rationale Setting admission control policy to AlwaysPullImages forces every new pod to pull the required images every time. In a multi-tenant cluster users can be assured that their private images can only be used by those who have the credentials to pull them. Without this admission control policy, once an image has been pulled to a node, any pod from any user can use it simply by knowing the image’s name, without any authorization check against the image ownership. When this plug-in is enabled, images are always pulled prior to starting containers, which means valid credentials are required. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes AlwaysPullImages. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. To configure this, follow the Kubernetes documentation and set the desired limits in a configuration file. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin SecurityContextDeny is set if PodSecurityPolicy is not used (Manual). Rationale SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes SecurityContextDeny, if PodSecurityPolicy is not included. Remediation: By default, RKE2 automatically enables the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin. Therefore, the SecurityContextDeny plugin need not be enabled. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin ServiceAccount is set (Automated). Rationale When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not includes ServiceAccount. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. If there’s a desire to use this argument, follow the documentation and create ServiceAccount objects as per your environment. Then refer to RKE2’s documentation to see how to supply additional api server configuration via the kube-apiserver-arg parameter. Ensure that the admission control plugin NamespaceLifecycle is set (Automated). Rationale Setting admission control policy to NamespaceLifecycle ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --disable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that does not include NamespaceLifecycle. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not use this argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin PodSecurityPolicy is set (Automated). Rationale A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls the actions that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to access. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies are comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features a pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access permissions. When the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin is in use, there needs to be at least one PodSecurityPolicy in place for ANY pods to be admitted. See section 1.7 for recommendations on PodSecurityPolicy settings. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --enable-admission-plugins argument is set to a value that includes PodSecurityPolicy. Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set (Automated). Rationale Using the NodeRestriction plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted to the Node and Pod objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets will only be allowed to modify their own Node API object, and only modify Pod API objects that are bound to their node. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 only sets NodeRestriction,PodSecurityPolicy as the parameter to the --enable-admission-plugins argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --insecure-bind-address argument is not set (Automated). Rationale If you bind the apiserver to an insecure address, basically anyone who could connect to it over the insecure port, would have unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your master node. The apiserver doesn’t do any authentication checking for insecure binds and traffic to the Insecure API port is not encrypted, allowing attackers to potentially read sensitive data in transit. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --insecure-bind-address argument does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 explicitly excludes the use of the --insecure-bind-address parameter. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0 (Automated). Rationale Setting up the apiserver to serve on an insecure port would allow unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your master node. This would allow attackers who could access this port, to easily take control of the cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kube-apiserver process with this argument’s parameter set to 0. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --secure-port argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The secure port is used to serve https with authentication and authorization. If you disable it, no https traffic is served and all traffic is served unencrypted. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --secure-port argument is either not set or is set to an integer value between 1 and 65535. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the parameter of 6443 for the --secure-port argument. No manual remediation is needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-path argument is set (Automated). Rationale Auditing the Kubernetes API Server provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected system by individual users, administrators or other components of the system. Even though currently, Kubernetes provides only basic audit capabilities, it should be enabled. You can enable it by setting an appropriate audit log path. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-path argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-path argument and parameter. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Retaining logs for at least 30 days ensures that you can go back in time and investigate or correlate any events. Set your audit log retention period to 30 days or as per your business requirements. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxage argument is set to 30 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxage argument parameter to 30. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. For example, if you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxbackup argument is set to 10 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxbackup argument parameter to 10. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. If you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would approximate have 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-log-maxsize argument is set to 100 or as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --audit-log-maxsize argument parameter to 100. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --request-timeout argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Setting global request timeout allows extending the API server request timeout limit to a duration appropriate to the user’s connection speed. By default, it is set to 60 seconds which might be problematic on slower connections making cluster resources inaccessible once the data volume for requests exceeds what can be transmitted in 60 seconds. But, setting this timeout limit to be too large can exhaust the API server resources making it prone to Denial-of-Service attack. Hence, it is recommended to set this limit as appropriate and change the default limit of 60 seconds only if needed. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --request-timeout argument is either not set or set to an appropriate value. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --request-timeout argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-lookup argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale If --service-account-lookup is not enabled, the apiserver only verifies that the authentication token is valid, and does not validate that the service account token mentioned in the request is actually present in etcd. This allows using a service account token even after the corresponding service account is deleted. This is an example of time of check to time of use security issue. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that if the --service-account-lookup argument exists it is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 doesn’t set this argument in favor of taking the default effect. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale By default, if no --service-account-key-file is specified to the apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be specified to the apiserver with --service-account-key-file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-key-file argument exists and is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-key-file explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a client certificate and key. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-certfile and --etcd-keyfile arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments exist and they are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If --client-ca-file argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the client-ca-file is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --client-ca-file argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --etcd-cafile argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a SSL Certificate Authority file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --etcd-cafile argument exists and it is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --etcd-cafile argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --encryption-provider-config argument is set to a EncryptionConfigfile. Additionally, ensure that the EncryptionConfigfile has all the desired resources covered especially any secrets. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --encryption-provider-config argument explicitly. No manual remediation needed. RKE2’s default encryption provider config file is located at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json and is configured to encrypt secrets. Ensure that encryption providers are appropriately configured (Automated). Rationale Where etcd encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the aescbc, kms and secretbox are likely to be appropriate options. Result: Pass Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a EncryptionConfig file. In this file, choose aescbc, kms or secretbox as the encryption provider. Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep aescbc /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/cred/encryption-config.json Run the below command on the master node. Verify that aescbc is set as the encryption provider for all the desired resources. Remediation By default, RKE2 sets the argument --encryption-provider-config and parameter. The contents of the config file indicates the use of aescbc. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the API Server only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --tls-cipher-suites argument is set as outlined in the remediation procedure below. Remediation: By default, RKE2 explicitly doesn’t set this flag. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate (Manual). Rationale Garbage collection is important to ensure sufficient resource availability and avoiding degraded performance and availability. In the worst case, the system might crash or just be unusable for a long period of time. The current setting for garbage collection is 12,500 terminated pods which might be too high for your system to sustain. Based on your system resources and tests, choose an appropriate threshold value to activate garbage collection. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --terminated-pod-gc-threshold argument with a value of 1000. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale The controller manager creates a service account per controller in the kube-system namespace, generates a credential for it, and builds a dedicated API client with that service account credential for each controller loop to use. Setting the --use-service-account-credentials to true runs each control loop within the controller manager using a separate service account credential. When used in combination with RBAC, this ensures that the control loops run with the minimum permissions required to perform their intended tasks. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --use-service-account-credentials argument is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --use-service-account-credentials argument to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with --service-account-private-key-file as appropriate. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --service-account-private-key-file argument with the service account key file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must verify the API server’s serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Providing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate to the controller manager with the --root-ca-file argument allows the controller manager to inject the trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API server. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --root-ca-file argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file containing the root certificate for the API server’s serving certificate Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --root-ca-file argument with the root ca file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that RotateKubeletServerCertificateargument exists and is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section contains recommendations relating to Scheduler configuration flags Ensure that the --profiling argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale Profiling allows for the identification of specific performance bottlenecks. It generates a significant amount of program data that could potentially be exploited to uncover system and program details. If you are not experiencing any bottlenecks and do not need the profiler for troubleshooting purposes, it is recommended to turn it off to reduce the potential attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --profiling argument is set to false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --profiling flag parameter to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1 (Automated). Rationale The Scheduler API service which runs on port 10251/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster’s attack surface. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-scheduler | grep -v grep Verify that the --bind-address argument is set to 127.0.0.1. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --bind-address argument to 127.0.0.1. No manual remediation needed. This section covers recommendations for etcd configuration. Ensure that the cert-file and key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'cert-file|key-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the cert-file and the key-file fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Server and peer cert and key files are specified. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the client-cert-auth field is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the client-cert-auth field is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. client-cert-auth is set to true. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the auto-tls argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-cert-file and peer-key-file fields are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit and also amongst peers in the etcd clusters. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep -E 'peer-server-client.crt|peer-server-client.key' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set as appropriate. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the peer-server-client.crt and peer-server-client.key fields are set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the client-cert-auth field is set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'client-cert-auth' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that the client-cert-auth field in the peer section is set to true. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, the client-cert-auth field is set. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the peer-auto-tls field is not set to true (Automated). Rationale etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be accessible only by authenticated etcd peers in the etcd cluster. Hence, do not use self- signed certificates for authentication. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. grep 'peer-auto-tls' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config Verify that if the peer-auto-tls field does not exist. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config. Within the file, it does not contain the peer-auto-tls field. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that a unique Certificate Authority is used for etcd (Manual). Rationale etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. Its access should be restricted to specifically designated clients and peers only. Authentication to etcd is based on whether the certificate presented was issued by a trusted certificate authority. There is no checking of certificate attributes such as common name or subject alternative name. As such, if any attackers were able to gain access to any certificate issued by the trusted certificate authority, they would be able to gain full access to the etcd database. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # To find the ca file used by etcd: grep 'trusted-ca-file' /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config # To find the kube-apiserver process: /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the file referenced by the client-ca-file flag in the apiserver process is different from the file referenced by the trusted-ca-file parameter in the etcd configuration file. Remediation: By default, RKE2 uses a config file for etcd that can be found at /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/db/etcd/config and the trusted-ca-file parameters in it are set to unique values specific to etcd. No manual remediation needed. Client certificate authentication should not be used for users (Manual). Rationale With any authentication mechanism the ability to revoke credentials if they are compromised or no longer required, is a key control. Kubernetes client certificate authentication does not allow for this due to a lack of support for certificate revocation. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Review user access to the cluster and ensure that users are not making use of Kubernetes client certificate authentication. Remediation: Alternative mechanisms provided by Kubernetes such as the use of OIDC should be implemented in place of client certificates. Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created (Automated). Rationale Logging is an important detective control for all systems, to detect potential unauthorised access. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep -v grep Verify that the --audit-policy-file is set. Review the contents of the file specified and ensure that it contains a valid audit policy. Remediation: Create an audit policy file for your cluster. Ensure that the audit policy covers key security concerns (Manual). Rationale Security audit logs should cover access and modification of key resources in the cluster, to enable them to form an effective part of a security environment. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Ensure that the kubelet service file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet service file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet service file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the kubelet service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t launch the kubelet as a service. It is launched and managed by the RKE2 supervisor process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The kube-proxy kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. It is possible to run kube-proxy with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml 644 Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubeconfig file for kube-proxy controls various parameters for the kube-proxy service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests/rke2-kube-proxy.yaml root:root Verify that if a file is specified and it exists, the permissions are 644 or more restrictive. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates rke2-kube-proxy.yaml with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the worker node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig 644 Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with 644 permissions. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the kubelet.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Manual). Rationale The kubelet.conf file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls various parameters that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/kubelet.kubeconfig root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates kubelet.kubeconfig with root:root ownership. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the certificate authorities file permissions are set to 644 or more restrictive (Manual). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %a /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt 644 Verify that the permissions are 644. Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/server-ca.crt with 644 permissions. Ensure that the client certificate authorities file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The certificate authorities file controls the authorities used to validate API requests. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt root:root Remediation: By default, RKE2 creates /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/tls/client-ca.crt with root:root ownership. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file has permissions set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. Ensure that the kubelet configuration file ownership is set to root:root (Automated). Rationale The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the --config argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by root:root. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 doesn’t require or maintain a configuration file for the kubelet process. All configuration is passed to it as command line arguments at run time. This section contains recommendations for kubelet configuration. Ensure that the --anonymous-auth argument is set to false (Automated). Rationale When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the Kubelet server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the value for --anonymous-auth is false. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts kubelet with --anonymous-auth set to false. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --authorization-mode argument is not set to AlwaysAllow (Automated). Rationale Kubelets, by default, allow all authenticated requests (even anonymous ones) without needing explicit authorization checks from the apiserver. You should restrict this behavior and only allow explicitly authorized requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that AlwaysAllow is not present. Remediation: RKE2 starts kubelet with Webhook as the value for the --authorization-mode argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --client-ca-file argument has a ca file associated. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --client-ca-file. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0 (Automated). Rationale The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that the --read-only-port argument is set to 0. Remediation: By default, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --read-only-port argument set to 0. Ensure that the --streaming-connection-idle-timeout argument is not set to 0 (Automated). Rationale Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports. By default, --streaming-connection-idle-timeout is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify that there’s nothing returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set --streaming-connection-idle-timeout when starting kubelet. Ensure that the --protect-kernel-defaults argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kernel parameters are usually tuned and hardened by the system administrators before putting the systems into production. These parameters protect the kernel and the system. Your kubelet kernel defaults that rely on such parameters should be appropriately set to match the desired secured system state. Ignoring this could potentially lead to running pods with undesired kernel behavior. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: When running with the profile flag set to cis-1.6, RKE2 starts the kubelet process with the --protect-kernel-defaults argument set to true. Ensure that the --make-iptables-util-chains argument is set to true (Automated). Rationale Kubelets can automatically manage the required changes to iptables based on how you choose your networking options for the pods. It is recommended to let kubelets manage the changes to iptables. This ensures that the iptables configuration remains in sync with pods networking configuration. Manually configuring iptables with dynamic pod network configuration changes might hamper the communication between pods/containers and to the outside world. You might have iptables rules too restrictive or too open. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify there are no results returned. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not set the --make-iptables-util-chains argument. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the --hostname-override argument is not set (Manual). Rationale Overriding hostnames could potentially break TLS setup between the kubelet and the apiserver. Additionally, with overridden hostnames, it becomes increasingly difficult to associate logs with a particular node and process them for security analytics. Hence, you should setup your kubelet nodes with resolvable FQDNs and avoid overriding the hostnames with IPs. Result: Not Applicable Remediation: RKE2 does set this parameter for each host, but RKE2 also manages all certificates in the cluster. It ensures the hostname-override is included as a subject alternative name (SAN) in the kubelet’s certificate. Ensure that the --event-qps argument is set to 0 or a level which ensures appropriate event capture (Manual). Rationale It is important to capture all events and not restrict event creation. Events are an important source of security information and analytics that ensure that your environment is consistently monitored using the event data. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: See CIS Benchmark guide for further details on configuring this. Ensure that the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated). Rationale Kubelet communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the Kubelets to serve only HTTPS traffic. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Verify the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments are present and set appropriately. Remediation: By default, RKE2 sets the --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key-file arguments when executing the kubelet process. Ensure that the --rotate-certificates argument is not set to false (Manual). Rationale The --rotate-certificates setting causes the kubelet to rotate its client certificates by creating new CSRs as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there is no downtime due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. This feature also require the RotateKubeletClientCertificate feature gate to be enabled (which is the default since Kubernetes v1.7). Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true (Manual). Rationale RotateKubeletServerCertificate causes the kubelet to both request a serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. This recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /bin/ps -ef | grep kubelet | grep -v grep Remediation: By default, RKE2 implements it’s own logic for certificate generation and rotation. Ensure that the Kubelet only makes use of Strong Cryptographic Ciphers (Manual). Rationale TLS ciphers have had a number of known vulnerabilities and weaknesses, which can reduce the protection provided by them. By default Kubernetes supports a number of TLS cipher suites including some that have security concerns, weakening the protection provided. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Configuration of the parameter is dependent on your use case. Please see the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark for suggestions on configuring this for your use case. Ensure that the cluster-admin role is only used where required (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as cluster-admin provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as cluster-admin allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a ClusterRoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a RoleBinding, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding’s namespace, including the namespace itself. Result: Pass Remediation: RKE2 does not make inappropriate use of the cluster-admin role. Operators must audit their workloads of additional usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to secrets (Manual). Rationale Inappropriate access to secrets stored within the Kubernetes cluster can allow for an attacker to gain additional access to the Kubernetes cluster or external resources whose credentials are stored as secrets. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: RKE2 limits its use of secrets for the system components appropriately, but operators must audit the use of secrets by their workloads. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize wildcard use in Roles and ClusterRoles (Manual). Rationale The principle of least privilege recommends that users are provided only the access required for their role and nothing more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide excessive rights to the Kubernetes API. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Audit: Run the below command on the master node. # Retrieve the roles defined across each namespaces in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml # Retrieve the cluster roles defined in the cluster and review for wildcards /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get clusterroles -o yaml Verify that there are not wildcards in use. Remediation: Operators should review their workloads for proper role usage. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Minimize access to create pods (Manual). Rationale The ability to create pods in a cluster opens up possibilities for privilege escalation and should be restricted, where possible. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: Operators should review who has access to create pods in their cluster. See the CIS Benchmark guide for more details. Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used. (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. Result: Pass. Audit: For each namespace in the cluster, review the rights assigned to the default service account and ensure that it has no roles or cluster roles bound to it apart from the defaults. Additionally ensure that the automountServiceAccountToken: false setting is in place for each default service account. Remediation: Create explicit service accounts wherever a Kubernetes workload requires specific access to the Kubernetes API server. Modify the configuration of each default service account to include this value automountServiceAccountToken: false Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary (Manual). Rationale Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster. Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue. Result: Manual - Operator Dependent Remediation: The pods launched by RKE2 are part of the control plane and generally need access to communicate with the API server, thus this control does not apply to them. Operators should review their workloads and take steps to modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace (Automated). Rationale Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit privileged containers. If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl describe psp global-restricted-psp | grep MustRunAsNonRoot Verify that the result is Rule: MustRunAsNonRoot. Remediation: RKE2, when run with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument, will disallow the use of privileged containers. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace. If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.hostPID == null) or (.spec.hostPID == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the hostPID value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. When reviewing PSPs, note that the Kubernetes API only displays this field if it is explicitly set to true. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host IPC namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s IPC namespace can use IPC to interact with processes outside the container. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host IPC namespace. If you have a requirement to containers which require hostIPC, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.hostIPC == null) or (.spec.hostIPC == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the HostIPC value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. When reviewing PSPs, note that the Kubernetes API only displays this field if it is explicitly set to true. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace (Automated). Rationale A container running in the host’s network namespace could access the local loopback device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share the host network namespace. If you have need to run containers which require hostNetwork, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.hostNetwork == null) or (.spec.hostNetwork == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the HostNetwork value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. When reviewing PSPs, note that the Kubernetes API only displays this field if it is explicitly set to true. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers with allowPrivilegeEscalation (Automated). Rationale A container running with the allowPrivilegeEscalation flag set to true may have processes that can gain more privileges than their parent. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to allow privilege escalation. The option exists (and is defaulted to true) to permit setuid binaries to run. If you have need to run containers which use setuid binaries or require privilege escalation, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == null) or (.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the allowPrivilegeEscalation value to false explicitly for the PSP it creates. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of root containers (Automated). Rationale Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout. Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root users in a container. If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp -o json | jq .items[] | jq -r 'select((.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == null) or (.spec.allowPrivilegeEscalation == false))' | jq .metadata.name | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo '--count={}' Verify that the returned count is 1. Remediation: RKE2 sets the runAsUser.Rule value to MustRunAsNonRoot in the PodSecurityPolicy that it creates. No manual remediation is needed. Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is enabled which may be misused by malicious containers. Ideally, all containers should drop this capability. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers with the NET_RAW capability from launching. If you need to run containers with this capability, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp global-restricted-psp -o json | jq .spec.requiredDropCapabilities[] Verify the value is \"ALL\". Remediation: RKE2 sets .spec.requiredDropCapabilities[] to a value of All. No manual remediation needed. Minimize the admission of containers with added capabilities (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities outside this set can be added to containers which could expose them to risks of container breakout attacks. There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers with capabilities beyond the default set from launching. If you need to run containers with additional capabilities, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp Verify that there are no PSPs present which have allowedCapabilities set to anything other than an empty array. Remediation: When run with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument RKE2 applies a PodSecurityPolicy that sets requiredDropCapabilities to ALL. No manual remediation needed. Minimize the admission of containers with capabilities assigned (Manual). Rationale Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the Container Runtime. Capabilities are parts of the rights generally granted on a Linux system to the root user. In many cases applications running in containers do not require any capabilities to operate, so from the perspective of the principal of least privilege use of capabilities should be minimized. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get psp Remediation: When run with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument RKE2 applies a PodSecurityPolicy that sets requiredDropCapabilities to ALL. No manual remediation needed. Ensure that the CNI in use supports Network Policies (Automated). Rationale Kubernetes network policies are enforced by the CNI plugin in use. As such it is important to ensure that the CNI plugin supports both Ingress and Egress network policies. Result: Pass Audit: Review the documentation of CNI plugin in use by the cluster, and confirm that it supports Ingress and Egress network policies. Remediation: By default, RKE2 use Canal (Calico and Flannel) and fully supports network policies. Ensure that all Namespaces have Network Policies defined (Automated). Rationale Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace. Result: Pass Audit: Run the below command on the master node. for i in kube-system kube-public default; do /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get networkpolicies -n $i; done Verify that there are network policies applied to each of the namespaces. Remediation: RKE2, when executed with the --profile=cis-1.6 argument applies a secure network policy that only allows intra-namespace traffic and DNS to kube-system. No manual remediation needed. Prefer using secrets as files over secrets as environment variables (Manual). Rationale It is reasonably common for application code to log out its environment (particularly in the event of an error). This will include any secret values passed in as environment variables, so secrets can easily be exposed to any user or entity who has access to the logs. Result: Manual Audit: Run the following command to find references to objects which use environment variables defined from secrets. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@..secretKeyRef)]} {.kind} {.metadata.name} {\"\\n\"}{end}' -A Remediation: If possible, rewrite application code to read secrets from mounted secret files, rather than from environment variables. Consider external secret storage (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports secrets as first-class objects, but care needs to be taken to ensure that access to secrets is carefully limited. Using an external secrets provider can ease the management of access to secrets, especially where secrets are used across both Kubernetes and non-Kubernetes environments. Result: Manual Audit: Review your secrets management implementation. Remediation: Refer to the secrets management options offered by your cloud provider or a third-party secrets management solution. Configure Image Provenance using ImagePolicyWebhook admission controller (Manual). Rationale Kubernetes supports plugging in provenance rules to accept or reject the images in your deployments. You could configure such rules to ensure that only approved images are deployed in the cluster. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that image provenance is configured as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and setup image provenance. The v1.5.1 guide skips 5.6 and goes from 5.5 to 5.7. We are including it here merely for explanation. These policies relate to general cluster management topics, like namespace best practices and policies applied to pod objects in the cluster. Create administrative boundaries between resources using namespaces (Manual). Rationale Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called default. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command and review the namespaces created in the cluster. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get namespaces Ensure that these namespaces are the ones you need and are adequately administered as per your requirements. Remediation: Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need them. Ensure that the seccomp profile is set to docker/default in your pod definitions (Manual). Rationale Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster. It should create a line as below: annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: docker/default Remediation: Review the Kubernetes documentation and if needed, apply a relevant PodSecurityPolicy. Apply Security Context to Your Pods and Containers (Manual). Rationale A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context. Result: Manual Audit: Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate. Remediation: Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark. The default namespace should not be used (Manual). Rationale Resources in a Kubernetes cluster should be segregated by namespace, to allow for security controls to be applied at that level and to make it easier to manage resources. Result: Manual Audit: Run the below command on the master node. /var/lib/rancher/rke2/bin/kubectl get all -n default Verify that there are no resources applied to the default namespace. Remediation: By default, RKE2 does not utilize the default namespace.","title":"CIS 1.6 Self-Assessment

prescriptive guidance for hardening a production installation of RKE2. It outlines the configurations and controls required to address Kubernetes benchmark controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS). For more details about evaluating a hardened cluster against the official CIS benchmark, refer to the CIS Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide v1.23, or Self-Assessment Guide v1.6 for RKE2 versions prior to v1.25. RKE2 is designed to be \"hardened by default\" and pass the majority of the Kubernetes CIS controls without modification. There are a few notable exceptions to this that require manual intervention to fully pass the CIS Benchmark: RKE2 will not modify the host operating system. Therefore, you, the operator, must make a few host-level modifications. Certain CIS controls for Network Policies and Pod Security Standards (or Pod Security Policies (PSP) on RKE2 versions prior to v1.25) will restrict the functionality of the cluster. You must opt into having RKE2 configure these for you. To help ensure these requirements are met, RKE2 can be started with the profile flag set to cis, cis-1.23, or cis-1.6 depending on the RKE2 version. This guide assumes that RKE2 has been installed, but is not yet running. If you have already started RKE2, you will need to stop the RKE2 service. There are three areas of host-level requirements: kernel parameters, kubelet’s protect-kernel-defaults and etcd process/directory configuration. These are outlined in this section. CIS benchmark requires some specific kernel parameters configuration to be set. When RKE2 is installed, it creates a sysctl config file to set the required parameters appropriately. However, it does not automatically configure the host to use this configuration. You must do this manually. The location of the config file depends on the installation method used. If RKE2 was installed via RPM, YUM, or DNF (the default on OSes that use RPMs, such as CentOS), run the following commands: sudo cp -f /usr/share/rke2/rke2-cis-sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/60-rke2-cis.conf sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl If RKE2 was installed via the tarball (the default on OSes that do not use RPMs, such as Ubuntu), run the following commands: sudo cp -f /usr/local/share/rke2/rke2-cis-sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/60-rke2-cis.conf sudo systemctl restart systemd-sysctl If your system lacks the systemd-sysctl.service and/or the /etc/sysctl.d directory, you will want to make sure the sysctls are applied at boot by running the following command during start-up: sudo sysctl -p /usr/local/share/rke2/rke2-cis-sysctl.conf Please perform this step only on fresh installations, before actually using RKE2 to deploy Kubernetes. Many Kubernetes components, including CNI plugins, set up their own sysctls. Restarting the systemd-sysctl service on a running Kubernetes cluster can result in unexpected side-effects. This is a kubelet flag that will cause the kubelet to exit if the required kernel parameters are unset or are set to values that are different from the kubelet’s defaults. RKE2 will automatically set the flag to true when the profile flag is set. protect-kernel-defaults is exposed as a top-level flag for RKE2. If you have set profile to cis-1.XX and protect-kernel-defaults to false explicitly, RKE2 will exit with an error. RKE2 will also check the same kernel parameters that the kubelet does and exit with an error following the same rules as the kubelet. This is done as a convenience to help the operator more quickly and easily identify what kernel parameters are violating the kubelet defaults. The CIS Benchmark requires that the etcd data directory be owned by the etcd user and group. This implicitly requires the etcd process run as the host-level etcd user. To achieve this, RKE2 takes several steps when started with a valid cis or cis-1.XX profile: Check that the etcd user and group exists on the host. If they don’t, exit with an error. Create etcd’s data directory with etcd as the user and group owner. Ensure the etcd process is run as the etcd user and group by setting the etcd static pod’s SecurityContext appropriately. On some Linux distributions, the useradd command will not create a group. The -U flag is included below to account for that. This flag tells useradd to create a group with the same name as the user. sudo useradd -r -c \"etcd user\" -s /sbin/nologin -M etcd -U v1.25 and Newer v1.24 and Older Generic CIS configuration Version Gate Available with October 2023 releases (v1.25.15+rke2r1, v1.26.10+rke2r1, v1.27.7+rke2r1, v1.28.3+rke2r1) profile: \"cis\" Using the generic cis profile will ensure that the cluster passes the CIS benchmark (rke2-cis-1.XX-profile-hardened) associated with the Kubernetes version that RKE2 is running. For example, RKE2 v1.28.XX with the profile: cis will pass the rke2-cis-1.7-profile-hardened in Rancher. Use of the generic cis profile ensures that upgrades to RKE2 do not require a change to existing configuration. Whatever changes are necessary to pass applicable CIS benchmark will be automatically applied. A rough mapping of RKE2 versions to CIS benchmark versions is as follows: CIS Benchmark Applicable RKE2 Minors Profile Flag 1.5 1.15-1.18 cis-1.5 1.6 1.19-1.22 cis-1.6 1.23 1.23 cis-1.23 1.24 1.24 cis-1.23 1.7 1.25-1.28 cis-1.23, cis 1.8 1.29+ cis CIS v1.23 configuration For older versions of 1.25 and 1.26, the cis-1.23 profile is still available. This profile will ensure that the cluster passes the CIS v1.7 benchmark (rke2-cis-1.7-profile-hardened) available in Rancher. yaml profile: \"cis-1.23\" Below is the minimum necessary configuration needed for hardening RKE2 to pass CIS v1.6 hardened profile rke2-cis-1.6-profile-hardened available in Rancher. yaml profile: \"cis-1.6\" # CIS 4.2.6, 5.2.1, 5.2.8, 5.2.9, 5.3.2 The configuration file must be named config.yaml and placed in /etc/rancher/rke2. The directory needs to be created prior to installing RKE2. When the profile flag is set it does the following: v1.25 and Newer v1.24 and Older Checks that host-level requirements have been met. If they haven’t, RKE2 will exit with a fatal error describing the unmet requirements. Applies network policies that allow the cluster to pass associated controls. Configures the Pod Security Admission Controller to enforce restricted mode in all namespaces, with the exception of the kube-system, cis-operator-system, and tigera-operator namespaces. These namespaces are exempted to allow system pods to run without restrictions, which is required for proper operation of the cluster. For more information about the PSA configuration, see the default Pod Security Admission configurations. For more information about Pod Security Standards, please refer to the official documentation. Checks that host-level requirements have been met. If they haven’t, RKE2 will exit with a fatal error describing the unmet requirements. Applies network policies that allow the cluster to pass associated controls. Configures runtime pod security policies that allow the cluster to pass associated controls. The runtime requirements to pass the CIS Benchmark are centered around pod security and network policies. Most of this is automatically handled by RKE2 when using a valid cis-1.XX profile, but some additional operator intervention is required. RKE2 always runs with some amount of pod security. On v1.25 and newer, Pod Security Admission (PSA) are used for pod security. A default Pod Security Admission config file will be added to the cluster upon startup as follows: With the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a restricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce restricted mode throughout the cluster with an exception to the kube-system, cis-operator-system and tigera-operator namespaces to ensure successful operation of system pods. Without the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a nonrestricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce privileged mode throughout the cluster which allows a completely unrestricted mode to all pods in the cluster. See the [Pod Security Policies](pod_security_standards.md) page for more details. v1.25 and Newer v1.24 and Older On v1.25 and newer, Pod Security Admission (PSA) are used for pod security. A default Pod Security Admission config file will be added to the cluster upon startup as follows: With the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a restricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce restricted mode throughout the cluster with an exception to the kube-system, cis-operator-system and tigera-operator namespaces to ensure successful operation of system pods. Without the cis/cis-1.23 profile: RKE2 will apply a nonrestricted pod security standard via a configuration file which will enforce privileged mode throughout the cluster which allows a completely unrestricted mode to all pods in the cluster. See the [Pod Security Policies](pod_security_standards.md) page for more details. On v1.24 and older, the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller is always enabled. A policy is applied based on the profile passed to RKE2. With the cis-1.6 profile: RKE2 will put a much more restrictive set of policies in place. These policies meet the requirements outlined in section 5.2 of the CIS Benchmark. Without the cis-1.6 profile: RKE2 will put an unrestricted policy in place that allows Kubernetes to run as though the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller was not enabled. See the [Pod Security Policies](pod_security_policies.md) page for more details. The Kubernetes control plane components and critical additions such as CNI, DNS, and Ingress are ran as pods in the kube-system namespace. Therefore, this namespace will have a policy that is less restrictive so that these components can run properly. When ran with a valid \"cis-1.XX\" profile, RKE2 will put NetworkPolicies in place that passes the CIS Benchmark for Kubernetes' built-in namespaces. These namespaces are: kube-system, kube-public, and default. The NetworkPolicy used will only allow pods within the same namespace to talk to each other. There are some notable exceptions to this is that it allows DNS requests to be resolved. DNS requests are allowed to reach the dns server HTTP/s requests are allowed to reach the ingress-nginx service HTTPs requests are allowed to reach the metrics-server Requests to the ingress-nginx webhook on the specified pod by the ingress-nginx pod (normally 8443) HTTPs requests to the rke2-snapshot-validation-webhook Operator Intervention Required Operators must manage network policies as normal for additional namespaces that are created. Set automountServiceAccountToken to false for default service accounts. Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. For each namespace including default and kube-system on a standard RKE2 install, the default service account must include this value: automountServiceAccountToken: false RKE2 will automatically set the value correctly for kube-system, cis-operator-system, kube-node-lease and tigera-operator namespaces. Operator Intervention Required For namespaces created by the cluster operator, the following script and configuration file can be used to configure the default service account. The configuration below must be saved to a file called account_update.yaml. apiVersion: v1 kind: ServiceAccount metadata: name: default automountServiceAccountToken: false Create a bash script file called account_update.sh. Be sure to sudo chmod +x account_update.sh so the script has execute permissions. #!/bin/bash -e for namespace in $(kubectl get namespaces -A -o=jsonpath=\"{.items[*]['metadata.name']}\"); do echo -n \"Patching namespace $namespace - \" kubectl patch serviceaccount default -n ${namespace} -p \"$(cat account_update.yaml)\" done Execute this script to apply the account_update.yaml configuration to default service account in all namespaces. CIS requirements 1.2.22 to 1.2.25 are related to configuring audit logs for the API Server. When RKE2 is started with the profile flag set, it will automatically configure hardened --audit-log- parameters in the API Server to pass those CIS checks. RKE2’s default audit policy is configured to not log requests in the API Server. This is done to allow cluster operators flexibility to customize an audit policy that suits their auditing requirements and needs, as these are specific to each users' environment and policies. A default audit policy is created by RKE2 when started with the profile flag set. The policy is defined in /etc/rancher/rke2/audit-policy.yaml. apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1 kind: Policy metadata: creationTimestamp: null rules: - level: None Operator Intervention Required To start logging requests to the API Server, at least level parameter must be modified, for example, to Metadata. Detailed information about policy configuration for the API server can be found in the Kubernetes documentation. After adapting the audit policy, RKE2 must be restarted to load the new configuration. sudo systemctl restart rke2-server.service API Server audit logs will be written to /var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/logs/audit.log. The following are controls that default RKE2 currently does not pass. Each gap will be explained and how it is addressed. Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd. etcd is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by etcd:etcd. This can be remediated by creating an etcd user and group as described above. Ensure that default service accounts are not actively used Kubernetes provides a default service account which is used by cluster workloads where no specific service account is assigned to the pod. Where access to the Kubernetes API from a pod is required, a specific service account should be created for that pod, and rights granted to that service account. The default service account should be configured such that it does not provide a service account token and does not have any explicit rights assignments. This can be remediated by updating the automountServiceAccountToken field to false for the default service account in each namespace. You can manually update this field on service accounts in your cluster to pass the control as described above. Ensure that all Namespaces have Network Policies defined Running different applications on the same Kubernetes cluster creates a risk of one compromised application attacking a neighboring application. Network segmentation is important to ensure that containers can communicate only with those they are supposed to. A network policy is a specification of how selections of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. Network Policies are namespace scoped. When a network policy is introduced to a given namespace, all traffic not allowed by the policy is denied. However, if there are no network policies in a namespace all traffic will be allowed into and out of the pods in that namespace. This can be remediated by starting RKE2 with the profile flag set in the configuration file as described above. If you have followed this guide, your RKE2 cluster will be configured to pass the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. You can review our CIS Benchmark Self-Assessment Guide v1.6 or v1.23 to understand how we verified each of the benchmarks and how you can do the same on your cluster.","title":"CIS Hardening Guide","component":"rke2","version":"latest","name":"hardening_guide","url":"/rke2/latest/zh/security/hardening_guide.html","titles":[{"text":"Host-level requirements","hash":"_host_level_requirements","id":1},{"text":"Kernel parameters","hash":"_kernel_parameters","id":2},{"text":"Kubelet parameter protect-kernel-defaults is set to true","hash":"_kubelet_parameter_protect_kernel_defaults_is_set_to_true","id":3},{"text":"etcd is configured properly","hash":"_etcd_is_configured_properly","id":4},{"text":"RKE2 configuration","hash":"_rke2_configuration","id":5},{"text":"Kubernetes runtime requirements","hash":"_kubernetes_runtime_requirements","id":6},{"text":"Pod Security","hash":"_pod_security","id":7},{"text":"Network Policies","hash":"_network_policies","id":8},{"text":"Configure default service account","hash":"_configure_default_service_account","id":9},{"text":"API Server audit configuration","hash":"_api_server_audit_configuration","id":10},{"text":"Known issues","hash":"_known_issues","id":11},{"text":"Control 1.1.12","hash":"_control_1_1_12","id":12},{"text":"Rationale","hash":"_rationale","id":13},{"text":"Remediation","hash":"_remediation","id":14},{"text":"Control 5.1.5","hash":"_control_5_1_5","id":15},{"text":"Rationale","hash":"_rationale_2","id":16},{"text":"Remediation","hash":"_remediation_2","id":17},{"text":"Control 5.3.2","hash":"_control_5_3_2","id":18},{"text":"Rationale","hash":"_rationale_3","id":19},{"text":"Remediation","hash":"_remediation_3","id":20},{"text":"Conclusion","hash":"_conclusion","id":21}]},"92":{"id":92,"text":"本文档描述了 RKE2 如何配置 PodSecurityPolicies 和 NetworkPolicies 来确保默认安全，同时还为操作人员提供了最大的配置灵活性。 版本 本文档适用于 RKE2 v1.24 及更早版本，请参阅 Pod 安全标准文档了解 RKE2 v1.25 及更高版本的默认策略。 RKE2 可以在有或没有 profile: cis-1.6 配置参数的情况下运行。这将导致它在启动时应用不同的 PodSecurityPolicies (PSP)。 如果使用 cis-1.6 配置文件运行，RKE2 将对除 kube-system 之外的所有命名空间应用名为 global-restricted-psp 的限制性策略。kube-system 命名空间需要一个名为 system-unrestricted-psp 的低限制策略才能启动关键组件。 如果在没有 cis-1.6 配置文件的情况下运行，RKE2 将应用一个名为 global-unrestricted-psp 的完全不受限制的策略，相当于在没有启用 PSP 准入控制器的情况下运行。 RKE2 将在初始启动时实施这些策略，但之后不会修改它们，除非如下文所述由集群操作员明确触发。这是为了让操作员能够完全控制 PSP，而不被 RKE2 的默认值所干扰。 PSP 的创建和应用由 kube-system 命名空间上是否存在某些注释来控制。它们直接映射到可以创建的 PSP： psp.rke2.io/global-restricted psp.rke2.io/system-unrestricted psp.rke2.io/global-unrestricted 在启动时对策略及其注释执行以下逻辑： 如果注释存在，RKE2 将继续执行而不采取进一步操作。 如果注解不存在，RKE2 会检查相关策略是否存在，如果存在，则删除并重新创建，同时将注解添加到命名空间中。 对于 global-unrestricted-psp，不会重新创建策略。这是为了在不降低集群安全性的情况下在 CIS 和非 CIS 模式之间移动。 在创建策略的时候，集群角色和集群角色绑定也被创建，从而确保默认使用合适的策略。 因此，在初始启动后，操作员可以修改或删除 RKE2 的策略，RKE2 将尊重这些变化。此外，要 \"重置\" 一个策略，操作者只需要从 kube-system 命名空间中删除相关的注释，然后重新启动 RKE2。 这些策略概述如下，以最受限制的 global-restricted PSP 开始。 apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: global-restricted-psp spec: privileged: false # CIS -

标签的节点（node-role.kubernetes.io/master 适用于 1.19 或更早版本）。agent-plan 通过指定一个标签选择器来选择没有该标签的节点，从而锁定 agent 节点。你也可以选择包含其他标签，如上例所示，它要求标签 “rke2-upgrade” 存在并且值不是 “disabled” 或 “false”。 agent-plan 中的 prepare 步骤会使该计划等待 server-plan 完成后再执行升级 job。 两个计划都将 version 字段设置为 v1.23.1+rke2r2。或者，你可以省略 version 字段并将 channel 字段设置为解析到 RKE2 版本的 URL。这将导致控制器监控该 URL，并在它解析到新版本时随时升级集群。这适用于版本 channels。因此，你可以用下面的 channel
